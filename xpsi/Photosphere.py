class Photosphere(ParameterSubspace):
    """ A photosphere embedded in an ambient Schwarzschild spacetime.

    :param obj hot:
        An instance of :class:`~.HotRegion.HotRegion` (or a derived class).
        This objects represents the hot regions of the surface that in most
        use-cases will be assumed to contain radiating material that is hotter
        than that *elsewhere*.

    :param obj elsewhere:
        An instance of :class:`~.Elsewhere.Elsewhere` (or a derived class).

    :param obj everywhere:
        An instance of :class:`~.Everywhere.Everywhere` (or a derived class).

    .. note::

        You cannot specify the surface radiation field *everywhere* if you
        use hot regions (the latter usage may also include specification of
        the radiation field *elsewhere*).

    :param dict bounds:
        Bounds are supplied for instantiation of a frequency parameter.
        The parameter name ``'mode_frequency'`` must be a key in the
        dictionary unless the parameter is *fixed* or *derived*. If a bound
        is ``None`` that bound is set equal to a strict hard-coded bound.
        If ``None``, lock the coordinate rotation frequency of a mode of
        asymmetry in the photosphere to a fixed frequency, e.g., the stellar
        rotation frequency. If bounds are passed, the frequency is interpreted
        as a free parameter.

    :param dict values:
        Either the fixed value of the mode frequency, a callable if the
        frequency is *derived*, or a value upon initialisation if the
        frequency is free. The dictionary must have a key with name
        ``'mode_frequency'`` if it is *fixed* or *derived*.
        If the asymmetry is locked to the stellar spin, then you need to pass
        the spin frequency. If fixed but different to the spin frequency, this
        value needs to be passed instead. In the hot region base class this
        mode frequency is applied to normalise the ray lags instead of the
        stellar rotation frequency.

    :param boolean stokes:
        A Boolean that determines whether the signals for all the Stokes I, Q,
        and U parameters are calculated. If False, only Stokes I is calculated.

    :param iterable custom:
        A :class:`~.Parameter.Parameter` instance or iterable over such
        instances. Might be useful for calling image plane extensions and
        passing global variables, without having to instantiate
        surface-discretisation classes and without having to handle global
        variable values at compile time or from disk for runtime access.

    .. note::

        In basic modelling patterns the frequency is the spin frequency,
        and thus you only need to explicitly pass the spin as ``value`` whilst
        leaving ``bounds`` to default. If the spin frequency happens to be a
        free parameter (perhaps with informative prior information), then
        pass a callable instead that can be used to get the spin frequency
        dynamically when the derived mode frequency variable is called for.
