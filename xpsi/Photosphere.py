class Photosphere(ParameterSubspace):
    """ A photosphere embedded in an ambient Schwarzschild spacetime.

    :param obj hot:
        An instance of :class:`~.HotRegion.HotRegion` (or a derived class).
        This objects represents the hot regions of the surface that in most
        use-cases will be assumed to contain radiating material that is hotter
        than that *elsewhere*.

    :param obj elsewhere:
        An instance of :class:`~.Elsewhere.Elsewhere` (or a derived class).

    :param obj everywhere:
        An instance of :class:`~.Everywhere.Everywhere` (or a derived class).
        Note that if you use construct the surface radiation field in this
        way, you should use the :attr:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.hot_atmosphere`
        property to pass a buffer of numerical data to the integrator
        routines. You then need to ensure that the extension modules
        ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/hot_radiation_field.pyx`` and
        ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/elsewhere_radiation_field.pyx`` match.

    .. note::

        You cannot specify the surface radiation field *everywhere* if you
        use hot regions (the latter usage may also include specification of
        the radiation field *elsewhere*).

    :param dict bounds:
        Bounds are supplied for instantiation of a frequency parameter.
        The parameter name ``'mode_frequency'`` must be a key in the
        dictionary unless the parameter is *fixed* or *derived*. If a bound
        is ``None`` that bound is set equal to a strict hard-coded bound.
        If ``None``, lock the coordinate rotation frequency of a mode of
        asymmetry in the photosphere to a fixed frequency, e.g., the stellar
        rotation frequency. If bounds are passed, the frequency is interpreted
        as a free parameter.

    :param dict values:
        Either the fixed value of the mode frequency, a callable if the
        frequency is *derived*, or a value upon initialisation if the
        frequency is free. The dictionary must have a key with name
        ``'mode_frequency'`` if it is *fixed* or *derived*.
        If the asymmetry is locked to the stellar spin, then you need to pass
        the spin frequency. If fixed but different to the spin frequency, this
        value needs to be passed instead. In the hot region base class this
        mode frequency is applied to normalise the ray lags instead of the
        stellar rotation frequency.

    :param boolean stokes:
        A Boolean that determines whether the signals for all the Stokes I, Q,
        and U parameters are calculated. If False, only Stokes I is calculated.

    :param iterable custom:
        A :class:`~.Parameter.Parameter` instance or iterable over such
        instances. Might be useful for calling image plane extensions and
        passing global variables, without having to instantiate
        surface-discretisation classes and without having to handle global
        variable values at compile time or from disk for runtime access.

    .. note::

        In basic modelling patterns the frequency is the spin frequency,
        and thus you only need to explicitly pass the spin as ``value`` whilst
        leaving ``bounds`` to default. If the spin frequency happens to be a
        free parameter (perhaps with informative prior information), then
        pass a callable instead that can be used to get the spin frequency
        dynamically when the derived mode frequency variable is called for.

        .. note::

            When the spacetime is static or extremely close to being static in
            a numerical context, at the resolutions we are interested in, we
            need to mitigate problems with rays that graze the pole
            infinitesimally close to the polar axis. In the vicinity of the
            polar coordinate singularity the ODE system is stiff and the
            solution is unstable. The most straightforward way to mitigate this
            is to perform a fallback forward Euler step for a ray that passes
            exactly through the pole, and use that ray as an approximation for
            the grazing ray that started very nearby on the image plane.
            Internally, if a ray intersects the image plane at
            :math:`x`-coordinate that is numerically very close to, but not
            exactly, zero (which would mean alignment to the rotational axis),
            it is approximated by a ray that intersects :math:`x=0`.
            Image-plane interpolation of quantities (such as intensity) for
            the purpose of visualisation will then smooth out any such
            artefacts.

            Moreover, as an additional measure against artefacts in the sky
            maps in the vicinity of the rotational pole, rays are distributed
            accordingingly. For example, if we request :math:`n=400` rays per
            dimension, a maximal spacing of the rays from the rotational axis
            is achieved by rotating the *spokes* of rays (by up to
            :math:`\pm\pi/n`) so that no spoke is aligned (or anti-aligned)
            with the :math:`y`-direction.

            Relative error tolerance per ray to adhere to during numerical
            integration.

        :param int max_steps:
            Maximum number of steps to permit per ray before forced termination
            of integration.

        :param float init_step:
            The initial *suggested* step size at the image plane for the
            affine parameter for each ray.

        :param float image_plane_radial_increment_power:
            Controls the behaviour of the radial discretisation.
            Higher values towards unity result in linear spacing of rays with
            the radial coordinate. Lower values towards zero squeeze the rays
            towards the visible stellar limb, which is necessary for resolving
            images of extended radiating elements. Values above unity are not
            recommended, and would squeeze rays towards the image-plane origin,
            compromising resolution at the stellar limb.

        :param int threads:
            Number of OpenMP threads to spawn for parallel blocks of code.
            Parallel blocks include ray integration to generate a global ray
            map from image plane to surface; and image calculation at a
            sequence of rotational phases.

        :param float cache_intensities:
            Cache the photon specific intensity sky maps in memory, as a
            function of phase and energy? The type must be a float (greater than
            or equal to zero) or ``False``. The value represents the limiting
            size in GB that can be allocated for the intensity cache. Defaults
            to zero because this dominates memory consumption. You need to
            activate this option if you want to plot the sky maps (see below).
            To activate, supply a limit. A hard limit of 2 GB is imposed for
            safety. To override, use the secret :obj:`_OVERRIDE_MEM_LIM`
            keyword argument to supply a positive limit in GB.

        :param ndarray[m] cache_phase_indices:
            A one-dimensional :class:`numpy.ndarray` of ``dtype=numpy.int32``,
            specifying the phase-array indices to cache intensities at. This
            is useful to save memory when you want to plot specific intensity
            skymaps but also compute the specific flux at many more phases. If
            ``None``, intensities will be cached at all phases subject to
            memory constraints. Note that the order of the list matters for
            plotting order, so the indices should generally increase, as should
            the phases themselves. If plotting the pulse-profile and spectrum,
            then this is a case where many more phases are useful for the
            resolving specific flux pulse-profile than are needed to plot
            specific intensity skymaps and specific flux spectra at three
            representative phases.

        :param ndarray[m] cache_energy_indices:
            A one-dimensional :class:`numpy.ndarray` of ``dtype=numpy.int32``,
            specifying the energy-array indices to cache intensities at. This
            is useful to save memory when you want to plot specific intensity
            skymaps but also compute the specific flux at many more energies. If
            ``None``, intensities will be cached at all energies subject to
            memory constraints. Note that the order of the list matters for
            plotting order, so the indices should generally increase, as should
            the energies themselves. If plotting the pulse-profile and spectrum,
            then this is a case where many more energies are useful for the
            resolving specific flux spectrum than are needed to plot specific
            intensity skymaps and specific flux pulse-profiles at three
            representative energies.

        :param bool single_precision_intensities:
            Cache the intensities in single precision? In most use cases,
            double precision is simply unnecessary, and because memory
            consumption can be high, choosing single precision can reduce
            memory requirements by a factor of two. Note that this only applies
            to the caching of intensities, not the calculation of intensities,
            which is done safely in double precision; only the final caching
            operation is a demotion cast to single precision. The default
            is single precision caching. Option ignored if intensities are not
            cached.

        :param bool plot_sky_maps:
            Plot (specific) intensity sky maps at a sequence of phases, or
            by averaging over phase. Maps can be made at one more energies
            or energy intervals. The images will be written to disk and
            can be used as frames in an animated sequence.

        :param dict sky_map_kwargs:
            Dictionary of keyword arguments passed to
            :meth:`~Photosphere._plot_sky_maps`. Refer to the associated
            method docstring for available options.

        :param bool animate_sky_maps:
            Compile images from disk into an animated sequence.

        :param bool free_memory:
            Try to free the imaging information before animating a sequence of
            sky maps written to disk, to try to avoid high memory usage. For
            safety the default is to free the memory, so deactivate this at your
            own risk. If there are other non-weak references created to the
            underlying objects, the memory may fail to be freed. In the
            methods below, the aim is that the native garbage collection cleans
            up the references because they only exist in the method local scope
            (no closures or globals).

        .. note::

            Memory used for plotting the sky maps and loading the images from
            disk to animate a phase sequence might not be straightforwardly
            freed despite efforts to do so, because of non-weak references
            covertly held by the matplotlib module.

        :param str atm_ext:
            Used to determine which atmospheric extension to use.
            Options at the moment:
            "BB": Analytical blackbody
            "Num4D": Numerical atmosphere using 4D-interpolation from the provided
            atmosphere data
            "user": A user-provided extension which can be set up by replacing the contents of 
            the file hot_user.pyx (and elsewhere_user.pyx if needed) and re-installing X-PSI
            (if not changed, "user" is the same as "BB").

        :param dict animate_kwargs:
            Dictionary of keyword arguments passed to
            :meth:`~Photosphere._animate`. Refer to the associated method
            docstring for available options.

        :param bool deactivate_all_verbosity:
            Deactivate the verbose output? Note that despite this keyword
            argument not appearing in the method signature, it is a valid
            switch.

        """ Helper method for specific intensity sky map visualization.

        Uses Delaunay triangulation to create an irregular sky mesh and
        calculate photon (specific) intensity contours at a sequence of phases.

        Each figure generated contains a sequence of panels arranged in
        one or two spatial dimensions. Each panel is an intensity sky map,
        either at a particular energy or integrated over a finite energy
        interval. Panels cannot mix specific and integrated intensities. Only
        a some sequence of energy (intervals), in any order, can be identified
        as labelling panels in one or two spatial dimensions. Time (rotational
        phase), whilst it could be defined to label a sequence of panels, is
        only identified as a labelling a sequence of *figures*.

        Similarly, sequence of energies could be identified as a variable
        labelling a sequence of figures, but is not. Moreover, energy and time
        could label panels in to spatial dimensions, but such mixing is not
        permitted. Finally, variables controlling the source-receiver system
        could be identified as labels of panels and/or figures, but this
        is also not supported. More complicated rendering patterns may be
        supported in future versions, but for now can be achieved via
        custom extensions building off of the current functionality.

        :param str _file_root:
            Relative or absolute path to parent directory for images,
            extended with the root name for the image files. E.g., the
            default is ``./images/skymap``. You do not need to change this
            unless you wish to, and is otherwise reserved for internal use.
            You may supply a custom file path via keywords ``root_dir`` and
            ``file_root`` upon calling :meth:`~Photosphere.image`, which are
            concatenated appropriately.

        :param ndarray[n] _phases:
            The phases at which the star was imaged. This is handled
            internally, so do *not* pass a keyword argument. If phase averaging,
            the minimum and maximum phases must be zero and :math:`2\pi`
            radians (i.e., zero and one cycles).

        :param ndarray[n] _energies:
            The energies at which the star was imaged. This is handled
            internally, so do *not* pass a keyword argument.

        :param ndarray[n] _c_idxs:
            The energy indices for which the intensity maps were cached for
            memory-efficieny plotting. This is handled internally, so do *not*
            pass a keyword argument.

        :param ndarray[n] _c_pidxs:
            The energy indices for which the intensity maps were cached for
            memory-efficieny plotting. This is handled internally, so do *not*
            pass a keyword argument.

        :param bool _redraw:
            Redraw the sky maps? This is handled internally, so do *not* pass
            a keyword argument.

        :param int threads:
            Number of OpenMP threads to spawn.

        :param bool with_pulse_profile_and_spectrum:
            A setting that fundamentally changes some behaviours. If
            deactivated (the default), only photon (specific) intensity skymaps
            are plotted. The following frame is an example:

        .. image:: _static/_skymap_plot.png

        :param bool with_pulse_profile_and_spectrum:
            If deactivated, the following keyword arguments do not have a use:
            :obj:`cycles` and :obj:`colormap`. If *activated*, photon specific
            intensity skymaps at three energies are plotted in each frame,
            together with their associated photon specific flux pulse-profiles,
            and also the photon specific flux spectrum at a finer array of
            energies. Use :obj:`panel_indices` to select the energies. The
            pulse-profiles are each normalised to their respective maxima,
            and the spectrum shows the relative orders of magnitude of the
            specific flux signals. The following frame is an example:

        .. image:: _static/_skymap_with_pulse_profile_and_spectrum_plot.png

        :param bool with_pulse_profile_and_spectrum:
            If activated, a subset of other keyword arguments are ignored:
            :obj:`energy_bounds`, :obj:`phase_average`, :obj:`panel_layout`,
            and :obj:`invert`. The panel layout is rigid (not customisable) in
            order to focus on the plot quality. If more energies were added, the
            information density in the plot-space might become too high without
            adding much more new information.

        :param bool time_is_space:
            Each image is at constant energy (or is a spectral trace up to
            that energy) instead of being at constant phase (or a pulse-profile
            trace up to that phase).

        :param tuple[int,int] panel_layout:
            Two elements: the number of rows and columns of panels. If ``None``,
            a layout is automatically determined based on the number of
            images to be plotted.

        :param iterable panel_indices:
            These ordered integers will be used to select intensity information
            by indexing the energy dimension of a 3D intensity array. If
            specific intensites are plotted, these integers should index
            a subset of energies at which the star was imaged. If intensities
            are plotted, these integers should index a subset of the energy
            intervals over which specific intensities are integrated. See
            the :obj:`energy_bounds` keyword argument. If the flux is
            calculated at more energies than specific intensities are cached
            at, then these integers need to index the
            :obj:`cache_energy_indices` array appropriately.

        :param int cycles:
            Nuber of cycles to generate images for. Only relevant if one cycle
            is different to the next in terms of the frame, e.g., most commonly
            if plotting the pulse-profile traces over more than one cycle. If
            frames separated by one cycle are identical, declare the number
            of cycles to the animator instead.

        :param bool phase_average:
            Average each sky map over one revolution (cycle) in phase?
            Note that the resulting image is incompatible with the currently
            supported animation mode. The following image is an example:

        .. image:: _static/_skymap_phaseaveraged.png

        :param bool bolometric:
            Integrate each sky map over energy? Note that the resulting image
            is incompatible with the currently supported animation mode.

        :param iterable energy_bounds:
            A set of two-element containers. Each container has an ordered pair
            of energies which delimit an integration domain. Specific intensity
            is integrated along each sky direction, at each phase, between
            these energy bounds. The bounds must be between the minimum and
            maximum energies at which the star was imaged. If ``None``,
            specific intensity sky maps will be plotted (the default). This
            option is ignored if energy is defined as the time dimension,
            meaning the sky maps are animated with respect to energy.

        :param iterable phase_bounds:
            A set of two-element containers. Each container has an ordered pair
            of energies which delimit an integration domain. Specific intensity
            is integrated along each sky direction, at each phase, between
            these energy bounds. The bounds must be between the minimum and
            maximum energies at which the star was imaged. If ``None``,
            specific intensity sky maps will be plotted (the default). This
            option is ignored if phase is defined as the time dimension,
            meaning the sky maps are animated with respect to phase.

        .. note::

            To use this functionality, the specific intensities must have
            been cached at all energies the specific flux is calculated at.

        :param int num_levels:
            Number of contour levels in (specific) intensity, distributed
            between minimum finite, and maximum values per panel, or over all
            panels. See :obj:`normalise_each_panel` keyword argument.

        :param bool add_zero_intensity_level:
            Add a contour level at zero intensity such that the colormap
            minimum corresponds to zero intensity? If ``True`` (the default),
            then the background sky, where there is by definition zero model
            intensity, has the same colour only as the subset of the image of
            the surface that is not radiating in the model. The disadvantage of
            this choice is that the intensity structure of the image as a
            function of phase and sky direction is generally not as well-
            resolved by the colour and greyscale variation. In the limit
            that the minimum finite intensity of the image is far smaller than
            the maximum, then the intensity resolution by colour and greyscale
            values is highest. If ``False``, then the minimum colour is
            assigned to the minimum finite intensity as a function of phase
            and sky direction. This also maximally resolves the intensity by
            colour and greyscale values, which is useful for models wherein the
            surface radiation field is constructed, for instance, from
            uniform-temperature localised hot regions. However, in this case
            the background sky colour is undefined; the background sky colour
            is thus set to the minimum colour in the colormap, meaning that the
            fainest subset of the image over phase and sky direction merges
            with the background sky in terms of colour and greyscale values.

        :param bool normalise_each_panel:
            Normalise the contour colormap to each skymap panel uniquely, or
            globally over all panels? The former yields relative intensity
            as function of phase and sky direction for an energy or energy
            interval, whilst the latter offers more spectral information but
            emission in some panels may not be discernable.

        :param bool invert:
            Invert the greyscale to show bright pixels as dark on a white
            plot background. If a colormap is manually supplied, this just
            controls the plot background colour. Inversion is recommended
            for printed format, whilst a black background is more intuitive
            when in digital format.

        :param obj colormap:
            Usage dependent on other settings. If not plotting the pulse-profile
            and spectrum, then this is simply a (matplotlib) colormap object.
            Choose something appropriate and *accessible* for a non-negative
            scalar field (sky intensities). If plotting the pulse-profile and
            spectrum too, then :obj:`colormap` can be the string
            ``'RedGreyBlue'`` to invoke the default colour scheme which is reds
            for the lowest energy intensity skymap and pulse-profile; pure
            greyscale for the intermediate energy; and blues for the highest
            energy.  Alternatively, if :obj:`colormap` is simply ``None``, the
            default greyscale will be used for all energies, with all
            pulse-profiles in black. Lastly, you can supply a three-element
            list or tuple of colormap objects, ordered from lowest to highest
            energy; the pulse-profile line colours will be retrieved as the
            midpoint of the colormap. Note that the background sky colour will
            be set to the lowest colour in each colourmap.

        :param tuple(int,int) figsize:
            The figure size (width, height) in *inches*. If the dimensions are
            inconsistent with the aspect ratio suggested by the
            :obj`panel_layout` settings, the height of the figure will be
            automatically rescaled to achieve congruence, meaning each panel is
            approximately square.

        :param bool usetex:
            Use TeX backend for figure text.

        :param float fontsize_scale:
            Use this argument to scale the font size of figure text relative
            to the default font size that is automatically determined based
            on the approximate panel size, which is in turn based on the
            figure size and the panel layout.

        :param tuple[float,float] tick_spacing:
            A two-element container. The first element is the minor tick
            spacing, and the second is the major tick spacing, for both
            the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions on the image plane. The
            units are both the maximum possible angular size of the image of the
            surface in an ambient Schwarzschild spacetime,
            :math:`R_{\\rm eq}/\\sqrt{1-r_{\\rm s}/R_{\\rm eq}}`.

        :param float tick_length_scaling:
            Use this argument to scale the axis tick lengths relative to the
            default lengths that are automatically determined based on the
            panel size.

        :param float dpi_scale:
            Use this argument to scale the dots per inch of the figure,
            relative to the default that is automatically determined based
            on the panel size.
