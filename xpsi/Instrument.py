    The body of the initialiser must not be changed to ensure inter-module
    compatibility, but can be extended if appropriate using a call to
    ``super().__init__``. Specialist constructors can be defined in a subclass
    using the ``@classmethod`` decorator.

    :param ndarray[p,q] matrix:
        A :math:`p \\times q` matrix which is the product of a redistribution
        matrix and effective area vector. The input energy intervals must
        increase along the columns of :attr:`matrix`, and the output channels
        must increase along the rows of :attr:`matrix`. The *units* of the
        elements must be that of an *effective* area (:math:`cm^2`). Generally
        there will be some available calibration product, and deviations from
        this nominal response model will be parametrised. So here load some
        nominal response matrix.

    :param ndarray[q+1] energy_edges:
        Energy edges in keV of the instrument energy intervals which must be
        congruent to the first dimension of the :attr:`matrix`: the number of
        edges must be :math:`q + 1`. The edges must be monotonically increasing.
        These edges will correspond to the nominal response matrix and any
        deviation from this matrix (see above).

    :param ndarray[p] channels:
        Instrument channel numbers which must be equal in number to the number
        of rows of the :attr:`matrix`. The number of channels must therefore be
        :math:`p`. These channels will correspond to the nominal response
        matrix and any deviation from this matrix (see above). In common usage
        patterns, the channel numbers will increase monotonically with row
        number, and usually increment by one (but this is not necessary).

    .. note::

        That these channel numbers are not used to index the loaded instrument
        (sub)matrix. The :attr:`xpsi.Data.index_range` property returns
        bounding row numbers that index the loaded instrument response
        (sub)matrix in order to operate on an incident signal flux. The
        channel array contained in :attr:`xpsi.Data.channels` must be a
        contiguous (ordered) subset of the channel array loaded here.

    .. note::

        The dimensions of the response matrix need not be equal, but it is
        required that the number of input intervals be greater than or equal to
        the number of output channels -- i.e., :math:`p \leq q`. If :math:`p <
        q` then it is implied that subsets of adjacent output channels are
        effectively grouped together.

    :param ndarray[p+1] channel_edges:
        The channel (energy) edges of the instrument, in keV. The array must
        be congruent to the zeroth dimension of the :attr:`matrix`: the number
        of edges must be :math:`p + 1`. The edges must be monotonically
        increasing. These edges will correspond to the nominal response matrix
        and any deviation from this matrix (see above).

    :param tuple args:
        Container of parameter instances.

    :param dict kwargs:
        If you want to prefix parameters of an instance of this instrument
        subspace with an identifier, pass it as keyword argument and it will
        find its way to the base class.
