""" Extensions to compute specific intensities in a local comoving frame.

Overview
--------

We require the surface radiation field model to be implemented in C extensions
to Python if signal computation is to be sufficiently fast. Signal computation
includes:

    * integrating over the image of a star on a distant observer's sky,
      yielding a phase-energy resolved signal for likelihood function
      evaluation;
    * resolving the image of star on a distant observer's sky as a function of
      phase and energy for visualisation purposes, and for more general
      simulation purposes.

The first type of signal computation is enabled by surface discretization,
whilst the latter is enabled via image-plane discretization. For surface
discretization there are two extension modules for users and developers to
work with: ``hot.pyx`` and ``elsewhere.pyx``. These extension modules contain
functions whose bodies enable evaluation of specific intensities with respect
to local comoving frames at the stellar surface. These functions have simple
default code (isotropic blackbody radiation field) but must generally be
customized for more advanced physics models. The ``hot.pyx`` module defines
the radiation field inside surface hot regions represented by
:class:`~xpsi.HotRegion.HotRegion` instances; however, the same module is used
by an instance of the :class:`~xpsi.Everywhere.Everywhere` class. The
``Elsewhere.pyx`` extension module defines the radiation field *exterior* to
the :class:`~xpsi.HotRegion.HotRegion` instances on the surface.

For image-plane discretization, the ``hot.pyx`` extension defines the local
surface radiation field properties with respect to a comoving frame. However,
to compute the variables required by this module to evaluate specific intensity,
another extension module is required with transforms a set of *global*
variables into local variables given spacetime coordinates of an event
belonging to a null geodesic connecting the surface to a radiation-detecting
distant instrument. Users and developers must customize the function bodies
in ``local_variables.pyx`` in order to implement more advanced physics models.

For all of these modules, numerical data can be read from disk to define the
functions for specific intensity evaluation given local variables, and for
transformation of global variables to local variables. A common usage pattern
is to statistically model data assuming some numerical physics model for the
radiation emergent from an atmosphere. Statistical modeling requires many
likelihood function evaluations, and therefore to avoid unnecessarily reading
numerical data from disk every time the likelihood function is called, users
can preload the numerical atmosphere data in an encapsulation Python process
and point to the data structures in memory when computing signals; developers
can develop extension modules to work with preloaded numerical atmosphere data.
When preloading an atmosphere, the number of grid points in each dimension
is dynamically inferred, but the existing source code for multi-dimensional
interpolation is hard-coded for four dimensions. With development, this can be
made more sophisticated.

Developers can contribute extension modules to the
``surface_radiation_field/archive``. Extensions from this archive must replace
the contents of the ``hot.pyx``, ``elsewhere.pyx``, and ``local_variables.pyx``
modules, adhering to the function prototypes defined in the associated
header files and using existing examples in the archive for guidance.

Use the Python-exposed functions below to test the C implementations of
surface radiation field models.

        first :math:`n-1` elements must be ordered to match the index
        arithmetic applied to the :math:`n^{th}` buffer. An example would be
        ``(logT, logg, mu, logE, buf)``, where:

        ``logg`` is a logarithm of effective surface gravity;

        the product of sizes of the first :math:`n-1` tuple elements.

        It is highly recommended that buffer preloading is used, instead
        of loading from disk in the customisable radiation field extension
        module, to avoid reading from disk for every signal
        (likelihood) evaluation. This can be a non-negligible waste of compute
        resources. By preloading in Python, the memory is allocated and
        references to that memory are not in general deleted until a sampling
        script exits and the kernel stops. The likelihood callback accesses
        the same memory upon each call without I/O.
