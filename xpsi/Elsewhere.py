    """ The photospheric radiation field *elsewhere*.

    This means the radiation field exterior to the hot regions. The local
    comoving radiation field properties are *assumed* (for now) to be
    azimuthally invariant but can in principle vary colatitudinally.

    :param int sqrt_num_cells:
        Number of cells in both colatitude and azimuth which form a regular
        mesh on the surface. Must be an even number such that half of the cells
        are exactly in one hemisphere. The total number of cells is the square
        argument value. The mesh suffers from squeezing in the polar regions,
        leading to a high degree of non-congruence in cell shape over the
        surface.

    :param int num_rays:
        Number of rays to trace (integrate) at each colatitude, distributed
        in angle subtended between ray tangent 4-vector and radial outward unit
        vector w.r.t a local orthonormal tetrad.

    :param dict bounds:
        If ``custom is None``, these bounds are supplied for instantiation
        of a temperature parameter. The parameter name
        ``'elsewhere_temperature'`` must be a key in the dictionary unless the
        parameter is *fixed* or *derived*. If a bound is ``None`` that bound
        is set equal to a strict hard-coded bound. We note that the bounds for
        parameters used in the atmosphere model should be restricted (by the user)
        to be within the tabulated values, in case a numerical atmosphere extension is used.

    :param dict values:
        Either the fixed value of the temperature elsewhere, a callable if the
        temperature is *derived*, or a value upon initialisation if the
        temperature is free. The dictionary must have a key with name
        ``'elsewhere_temperature'`` if it is *fixed* or *derived*.

    :param iterable custom:
        Iterable over :class:`~.Parameter.Parameter` instances. If you
        supply custom parameter definitions, you need to overwrite the
        :func:`~.Elsewhere.Elsewhere._compute_cellParamVecs` method to
        handle your custom behaviour.

    :param int image_order_limit:
        The highest-order image to sum over. A value of *one* means primary
        images only (deflections :math:`<\pi`) whilst a value of *two* means
        primary and secondary images (deflections :math:`<2pi`) where visible,
        and so on. If ``None`` (the default), there is no hard limit. In this
        case the limit is determined quasi-naturally for each mesh element,
        meaning that images will be summed over until higher order images are
        not visible or the visibility limit is truncated due to lack of
        numerical precision (e.g. for rays that orbit very close to the
        Schwarzschild photon sphere three times or more).  Higher-order images
        generally contribute less and less due to geometric projection effects
        (higher-order images become more tangential), and the images of
        elements get squeezed in solid angle at the stellar limb. In principle,
        effects such as relativistic beaming can counter this effect to a
        degree for certain source-receiver configurations, by increasing
        brightness whilst solid angle decreases, and thus the flux contribution
        relative to that from a primary image can be greater than suggested
        simply by geometric project effects. Nevertheless, inclusion of these
        images is more computationally expensive. If, when iterating through
        image orders, an image is not visible because the deflection required
        is greater than the highest deflection permitted at a given colatitude
        on a surface (accounting for the surface tilt due to rotation), then
        the iteration over image orders terminates.
