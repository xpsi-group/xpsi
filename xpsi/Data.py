class Data(object):
    r""" A container for event data.

    The working assumption is that the sampling distribution of this event data
    can be written in terms of a set of channel-by-channel *count*\ -rate
    signals. The instrument associated with this data in an instance of
    :class:`~.Signal.Signal` must transform incident signals into a structure
    congruent to that of the event data. The attributes and methods of this
    class and any derived classes must therefore store information required for
    this operation.

    The initialiser assigns observation settings to attributes which are
    required for the treating the incident specific flux signals using the
    model instrument. The body of the initialiser may be changed, but to ensure
    inter-module compatibility, only the phase handling should really be
    modified, for instance if you want to implement an unbinned likelihood
    function with respect to phase; the phase bins defined in this concrete
    implementation are only used by a custom implementation of the
    likelihood function (i.e., by a subclass of :class:`xpsi.Signal`), and
    not by the other concrete classes used to construct the likelihood
    callable. The initialiser can also be extended if appropriate using a call
    to ``super().__init__``. Specialist constructors can be defined in a
    subclass using the ``@classmethod`` decorator, for instance to load event
    data from disk into a compatible data structure in memory; an example of
    this may be found below.

    .. note::

        You can subclass in order to tailor the handling of the event data, for
        instance to implement a likelihood functions for unbinned event data.

    :param ndarray[n,m] counts:
        A :class:`~numpy.ndarray` of count numbers. The columns must map to
        the phase intervals given by :obj:`phases`. The rows of the array map
        to some subset of instrument channels.

    :param ndarray[n] channels:
        Instrument channel numbers which must be equal in number to the first
        dimension of the :attr:`matrix`: the number of channels must be
        :math:`p`. These channels will correspond to the nominal response
        matrix and any deviation from this matrix (see above). In common usage
        patterns, the channel numbers will increase monotonically with row
        number, and usually increment by one (but this is not necessary). It is
        advisable that these numbers are the actual instrument channel numbers
        so that plots generated by the post-processing module using these
        labels are clear.

    :param ndarray[m+1] phases:
        A :class:`~numpy.ndarray` of phase interval edges, where events are
        binned into these same intervals in each instrument channel.

    :param int first:
        The index of the first row of the loaded response matrix containing
        events (see note below).

    :param int last:
        The index of the last row of the loaded response matrix containing
        events (see note below).

    .. note::

        The :obj:`counts` matrix rows  *must* span a contiguous subset of the
        rows of the loaded response matrix, but in general can span an
        arbitrary subset and order of instrument channels. Note that the
        :obj:`first` and :obj:`last+1` numbers are used to index the loaded
        instrument response matrix.  Therefore, if you load only a submatrix of
        the full instrument response matrix, these indices must be appropriate
        for the loaded submatrix, and must not be the true channel numbers
        (this information is instead loaded in the :class:`xpsi.Instrument`).
        Of course, in all sensible usage patterns the order of the instrument
        channels, when mapped to matrix rows, will be such that channel number
        increases with matrix row number monotonically because, then the
        nominal event energy increases monotonically with row number, which is
        important for visualisation of data and model (because spatial order
        matches energy order and correlations in space can be discerned easily).
        However, there could in principle be channel cuts that mean an increment
        of more than one channel between matrix adjacent rows, and the
        response matrix needs to be manipulated before or during a custom
        loading phase such that its rows match the channel numbers assigned to
        the :obj:`counts` matrix rows.

    :param float exposure_time:
        The exposure time, in seconds, to acquire this set of event data.
