Changed the behaviour of instrument trimming. The "threshold" method was replaced with a "tolerance" method. Now, the response for each channel has a cumulative computed over the full energy range. 
We now select the maximum energy for the model by imposing the cumulative of all the channels to reach the (1-tolerance) quantile.

Changed the structure of ``InstrumentPileup`` in order to simplify it
