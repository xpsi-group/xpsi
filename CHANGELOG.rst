[v2.2.3] - 2024-05-23
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* A new parameter for the spin axis position angle was added when modelling polarized X-rays. In addition, polarimetry examples were updated and a few bugs in the module generator were fixed.

Fixed
^^^^^

* A bug in the module generator was fixed, so that selecting blackbody atmosphere works correctly. (D.C.)

* A bug in the module generator was fixed, so that not all the parameters are accidentally wrapped. (D.C., L.M.)

Added
^^^^^

* A new parameter called ``spin_axis_position_angle`` was added to the Photosphere class when calculating the pulses using the ``stokes=True`` option. This is the angle between the observer north and the projection of the pulsar rotation axis on the plane of the sky, affecting the observed polarization angle and Stokes parameters. (T.S.)

* An example of using a constant accretion disk background was added in ``xpsi/examples/examples_modeling_tutorial/TestRun_PolNum_split_1spot.py``. (T.S., B.D.)

[v2.2.2] - 2024-04-26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* The default imaging extension has been changed from ``uniform.pyx`` to ``PDT_U.pyx`` to avoid the need for X-PSI re-installation when computing neutron star images for different nested models. The tutorials have been updated to account for this change when necessary.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug in ``photosphere.image()`` causing the code crash if not providing the ``sky_map_kwargs`` argument.

* Fixed a bug in ``photosphere.image()`` causing the code crash if setting ``reimage=False`` and trying to plot the skymaps.

Added
^^^^^

* The Global surface emission -tutorial was added back to the documentation pages since it works now.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The default ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/local_variables.pyx`` extension is now ``PDT_U.pyx`` instead of ``uniform.pyx``. The former is a more general version of the latter, and also a more general version of ``PST_U.pyx`` and ``two_spots.pyx``. The new default extension can be used to compute neutron star images for all the aforementioned models without re-installing X-PSI. For the simpler models, one can define e.g. the global variable for ceding region size to be zero if no ceding regions exist in the model. The tutorials have been updated to have those variables defined when needed.

* Example scripts updated to have settings more commonly used in NICER analyses (for compactness limits and multiple imaging orders).

Removed
^^^^^^^

* Removed the archived versions of imaging extensions that are not needed anymore.

Fixed
^^^^^

* A bug in the projection tool for PDT-U model was fixed. (T.S., S.V.)

Added
^^^^^

* Added a keyword argument ``ci_gap`` for ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` that can be used to adjust the vertical space between the reported credible intervals above the contour plots. (T.S.)

Changed

[v2.2.0] - 2024-02-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Modeling polarized X-ray signals has been implemented and examples added for simulating polarized pulses (Stokes parameters) using a couple of different atmosphere options. Support for polarized likelihood calculation has also been included. In addition, new integrators (with and without polarimetry) have been implemented to allow atmosphere interpolations with 5 parameters to be performed in 2 steps.

Added
^^^^^

* Option to calculate and extract all the Stokes I, Q, and U signals as a function of energy and phase. This can be activated if giving ``stokes=True`` as an input parameter (default is ``stokes=False``) when initializing a photosphere object. The computed (photosphere) stokes signals can then be obtained using the ``signal``, ``signalQ``, and ``signalU`` functions of the Photosphere class. For using Stokes signals in the likelihood calculation, a separate signal object of the Signal class needs to be created for each Stokes signal so that the type of the signal is specified using a ``stokes`` input argument. A list of all the signals can be then given to the likelihood object when initializing it. (T.S.)

* Polarized alternatives for integrators in ``xpsi/cellmesh/integratorIQU_...``, which include the transportation of polarization angle from the star to the observer using the formalism of `Loktev et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202039134>`_. These are used when setting ``stokes=True`` as instructed above. (T.S.)

* A new "split" integrator in ``xpsi/cellmesh/``, which allows atmosphere interpolations with 5 parameters to be performed in 2 steps: first interpolating 3 parameters that do not vary within the hot region (creating a 2D data set) and then interpolating in 2D for each photon energy and emission angle. This can be activated by giving ``split=True`` (default is ``split=False``) input parameter when initializing a hotregion object. Setting ``split=True`` will automatically determine also the atmosphere option. (B.D.)

* New atmosphere options in ``xpsi/cellmesh/surface_radiation_field/``. See the docstring of the HotRegion class for all the options. (B.D., T.S.)

* Polarization tutorial to the documentation pages. (T.S.)

* Example scripts for calculating polarized pulses in ``examples/examples_modeling_tutorial/`` using either an analytical polarized burst atmosphere (``TestRun_Pol.py``) or a numerical 5D atmosphere model (``TestRun_PolNum_split_1spot.py`` or ``TestRun_PolNum_split_inference.py``). (T.S.)

* Example scripts for combining X-PSI to `ixpeobssim <https://github.com/lucabaldini/ixpeobssim>`_ for simulating polarized X-ray observations in ``examples/examples_modeling_tutorial/ixpeobssim/``. See instructions in the documentation. (T.S.)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* To allow modeling of all Stokes parameters, no error is anymore raised if the data have negative values in ``xpsi/Data.py``. (T.S.)

* No error is anymore raised in ``xpsi/Data.py`` if setting the first and last energy channel to be the same channel. (T.S.)

[v2.1.2] - 2024-02-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Updates and fixes were done to background marginalisation, post-processing, and module generator routines.

Added
^^^^^

* Added error messages in the background marginalisation if providing a background support that does not fulfill the documented requirements (T.S.).

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed the sometimes incorrect value of the factor (``B_for_integrand``) that should ensure that the exponent in the likelihood integrand is at some point unity within the integration domain in ``xpsi/likelihoods/default_background_marginalisation.pyx``. This was not always working when the background bounds were based both on the user-given bounds and on the default bounds leading to numerical problems in the integration and unnecessarily bad likelihood values in some example cases. Now ``B_for_integrand`` is forced to be within the integration limits (T.S.).

* Fixed module imports in ``xpsi/module_generator.py`` (D.C., T.S.).

* Fixed the background support upper limit zero replacements to work even when all the highest energy channels have zero background in ``xpsi/module_generator.py`` (T.S., S.V.).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Changed ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_metadata.py`` so that ``None`` can be given as truth value for a parameter, which is not wanted to be shown in a corner plot (T.S., Y.K.).

[v2.1.1] - 2023-11-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Updates and fixes done to post-processing, synthesise, and module generator routines.

Added
^^^^^

* An option ``show_vband`` added to the CornerPlotter class allowing to choose how many colored vertical bands are shown in the corner plots (Y.K., T.S., S.G).

* Options ``xticks`` and ``yticks`` added in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_signalplot.py`` to adjust the axis ticks and tick labels in signal plots for post-processing (T.S.).

* Examples of the new features added to the Post-processing tutorial (T.S.).

Fixed
^^^^^

* Displaying the credible intervals for all plotted posteriors fixed to work for multiple models and not only for multiple runs. The argument ``credible_interval_1d_all_show`` needs to be ``True`` to use this functionality (Y.K., T.S.).

* Corrected a deprecated version of numpy float in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` (M.H.).

* Synthesise function in ``xpsi/Likelihood.py`` forced to always use the given parameters and produce synthetic data regardless of other settings. (T.S.).

* Prior probability values prevented from being exactly zero (or negative) for KL-divergence calculation and avoiding thus infinite values for the reported KL-divergence estimates (T.S.).

* Module generator fixed to work with the current version of X-PSI and tutorial updated (T.S., D.C).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The 1D credible intervals for all the plotted posteriors are now always calculated (and saved if ``annotate_credible_interval=True``), even though not choosing to show all of them in a corner plot (Y.K).

[v2.1.0] - 2023-09-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Atmosphere switching implemented without need for re-installing X-PSI for different atmosphere extensions. **Note that old scripts using the numerical atmosphere extension need to be slightly modified (see Deprecated below).**

Added
^^^^^

* Atmosphere extension flag ``atm_ext`` that can be used to select the wanted atmosphere extension (for an instance of HotRegion, Elsewhere, or Everywhere class). The default option is a blackbody atmosphere, but a numerical atmosphere extension can be switched by setting ``atm_ext="Num4D"``.

* Beaming modification flag ``beam_opt`` (an integer) that can be used to select the wanted atmospheric beaming correction model for an instance of HotRegion or Everywhere class (not implemented to Elsewhere currently). The default option is no modification. See the docstring for HotRegion class for other options.

* Extra atmosphere extension ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/hot_user.pyx`` that can be replaced with a user-modified atmosphere model before (re-)installing X-PSI. This model can then be used by setting ``atm_ext="user"`` allowing still the possibility to use the other built-in options without re-installing X-PSI.

* Options to switch atmosphere extension and beaming option in the surface radiation field tools (``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/__init__.pyx``).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Documentation, tutorials, and example scripts updated for using the new atmosphere switching (except ``xpsi/module_generator.py``).

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* The previous way of installing X-PSI with different atmosphere extensions has been deprecated. **To use the old python scripts (files usually named as `main.py`) to run X-PSI with numerical atmosphere setup, one needs to add `atm_ext="Num4D"` as an input parameter for all the relevant HotRegion/Elsewhere/Everywhere objects.**

Removed
^^^^^^^

* Archived versions of atmosphere extensions that are not needed anymore.

[v2.0.3] - 2023-07-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Updates and bug fixes in post-processing.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug when defining ``param_plot_lims`` in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` caused by ``tight_gap_fraction`` being only defined in the customized GetDist version that is not used anymore. That parameter is now defined in X-PSI instead (T.S., Y.K., S.G.).

* Fixed a bug when combining multiple runs in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_runs.py``, which caused the combination sometimes fail since PolyChord (instead of MultiNest) default was used for the initial live point likelihoods in dead-birth files. This bug appeared after switching to use a non-customized version of NestCheck (after X-PSI version 2.0.0). Now the newest NestCheck version allows to change this value, and this change is now done within X-PSI. If trying to use an older NestCheck version, an error is raised (T.S., Y.K.).

* Fixed the hyphens in the file names in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_backends.py`` when reading MultiNest output files with the newest NestCheck version from GitHub, although trying still to read the filenames also with the older syntax to allow older NestCheck versions for other things than combining runs (T.S.).

Added
^^^^^

* Added a keyword argument in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` to allow user to define the decimal precisions for all the credible intervals printed in the figures (T.S.).

* Added a photosphere setter in ``xpsi/Star.py`` which should allow producing residual and signal plots for models with multiple photosphere objects as explained in ``https://github.com/xpsi-group/xpsi/issues/304`` (Y.K, T.S.).

* Added minor ticks back to corner plots in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py``. Previously, these ticks were produced by the customized older GetDist version (T.S.).

[v2.0.2] - 2023-06-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* More numerical problems in likelihood computation were fixed for cases with zero counts. These fixes seem not to have any effect on the current examples, but for data with zero counts at some energy channels, more parameter vectors can now have acceptable likelihoods.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Several numerical issues in ``xpsi/likelihoods/default_background_marginalisation.pyx`` for a given energy channel:

* Prevented the upper limit of the background from becoming negative if using the semi-bounded option of the background support and having both zero modeled and observed counts at all phases.

* Prevented the lower limit (and the initial guess) of the background from becoming negative if having zero observed counts at all phases but non-zero modeled counts at some phases.

* Prevented division by zero when estimating the standard deviation for the background that maximizes the likelihood in the case of zero observed counts at all phases but non-zero modeled counts at some phases.

[v2.0.1] - 2023-04-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Numerical problems in likelihood computation were fixed for cases with zero counts, preventing also the code from being incorrectly optimized on Intel CPUs when using Intel compilers (producing incorrect GSL integration results and likelihoods). For the tested cases, the effect of these fixes seems non-detectable for the results in the systems where the optimization was already working correctly. In addition, a likelihood check was added as a part of continuous integration tests.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Treatment of the special cases in the likelihood computation in ``xpsi/likelihoods/default_background_marginalisation.pyx`` was changed so that taking the logarithm of zero is not allowed anymore. Previously, that could happen if the modelled counts were zero, but the observed counts were not. In addition, in case they both are zero, we now add 0 (i.e., log(1)) to the log-likelihood, instead of 1 added before. (T.S., E.R., M.H.)

Added
^^^^^
* Continuous integration test for checking the likelihood (T.S.)

[v1.2.1] - 2022-12-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Hard upper bound for temperature increased from 7.0 to 7.6, allowed user an option to adjust when the exact likelihood calculation is skipped because of too bright signal, and license information updated.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Strict bounds for temperature changed in ``xpsi/HotRegion.py``, ``xpsi/Everywhere.py``, and ``xpsi/xpsi/Elsewhere.py`` to allow analysis for hotter neutron stars.

* Added mention in ``xpsi/HotRegion.py``, ``xpsi/Everywhere.py``, and ``xpsi/xpsi/Elsewhere.py`` that the user should set the parameter bounds to be within the values given in the numerical atmosphere table.

* Added a new input parameter ``slim`` to ``xpsi/likelihoods/default_background_marginalisation.pyx``, which can be used to adjust when the exact likelihood calculation is skipped because of the signal being too bright compared to the data. The default value of this parameter is set to the same value as in the code before (20.0).

* Made the warning in synthesise function in ``xpsi/Likelihood.py`` more accurate.

* Fetched the prior to likelihood object in ``examples/examples_fast/Synthetic_data.ipynb`` to make sure prior bounds are checked when synthesising data.

* License of X-PSI was changed from MIT to GPLv3.

[v0.7.12] - 2022-09-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Since version 0.7.11. a few changes have been made including updates to the documentation and the handling of numerical problems in ray tracing. The latter fix can potentially have a small effect on the calculated pulse profiles and likelihood values for some parameter vectors, but according to testing that effect is very minor at most.


Fixed
^^^^^

* Numerical problem in  ``xpsi/cellmesh/rays.pyx`` for certain paramaters causing sporadic warnings in later computation. This is prevented by allowing small rounding errors when checking if sin_alpha parameter is unity, and in case NaNs still occur, replacing them with zero (T.S.).

* Comment about returned variables updated to include the best-fitting background limited by the support in ``xpsi/likelihoods/default_background_marginalisation.pyx`` (T.S.).

* The photosphere object validity check in ``xpsi/Star.py`` which incorrectly failed if all photosphere parameters were fixed (D.C., Y.K., T.S.).

Added
^^^^^

* Added more information and warnings about about switching between the blackbody and numerical atmosphere extensions in the documentation for Installation, Surface radiation field tools and (FA)Q pages. Added also a links to the Zenodo publication of Riley+2021 from where the numerical atmosphere data can be obtained (T.S.).

* Added a new kwargs ("prior_samples_fnames") used in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` to allow user to set the name of file from where the prior samples are read/saved (T.S.).

* Added comments about the new kwargs (introduced already in version 0.7.11) in the function descriptions used in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` visible also for the documentation (T.S.).

* Added an option to force update ``xpsi/Star.py`` to avoid errors, for example, when all paremeters are fixed and X-PSI thinks otherwise that updating can be skipped (T.S., D.C., Y.K.).

* Added options allowing the user to truly force update the likelihood in ``xpsi/Likelihood.py`` and avoid errors caused by the automatic need-update-checks not working for all the possible cases. Added also an error message suggesting to use those options if the usual "AttributeError: 'CustomSignal' object has no attribute '_loglikelihood'" would be encountered (T.S.).

[v0.7.11] - 2022-08-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Since version 0.7.10, a few bugs have been fixed in the module generator, error handling and postprocessing. Also, new error/warning messages are given if trying to use wrong atmosphere extension. In addition, some improvements have also been added to the postprocessing (possibility to e.g. save and read the drawn priors to produce corner plots much faster), without mentioning them in the documentation yet.


Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug in ``xpsi/EnsembleSampler.py`` when initializing walkers. Need to use "self._prior" instead of "prior" (Y.K.).

* Bug (typo) in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_pulse.py`` when plotting the true signal. Need to use "component" instead of "eomponent" (G.L.).

* Several bugs (typos) in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_spectrum.py`` when plotting the true signal (T.S., G.L.).

* Issues with ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` not being able to plot the cross hairs for true parameter values in the corner plot if only a subset of model parameters chosen for the figure (T.S., Y.K.).

* Error handling in ``xpsi/Signal.py`` when the number of event data channels does not match the number of the instrument data channels (S.G.).

* Fixed reference to incident_background in the modeling tutorial (B.D.).

* Several bug fixes in ``xpsi/module_generator.py`` (D.C.).

Added
^^^^^

* Added a warning message in the blackbody atmosphere extension  ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/hot.pyx`` if providing numerical atmosphere data (T.S.).

* Added an error message in the numerical atmosphere extension  ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/archive/hot/numerical.pyx`` before a segmentation fault error caused by not loading the numerical atmosphere data (T.S.).

* Added a warning when trying to synthetize data in ``xpsi/Likelihood.py`` with input parameters outside of the defined prior bounds, finishing without errors but with no data produced (Y.K. & T.S.).

* Added option for the user to set the line colors for different runs in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` using kwargs (T.S.).

* Added possibility to save and read the previously drawn prior samples in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` using "force_draw" kwargs (T.S.).

* Added possibility to plot the priors only for the first run in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` using "priors_identical" kwargs, if known that priors are the same for all runs (T.S.).

* Saved credible intervals in numerical format that can be accessed after plotting the corner plot (see "val_cred" in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` and ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_postprocessor.py``) (Y.K., T.S.).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Since version 0.7.9, several bugs have been fixed. For example, fixing the double counting of the second component of a dual temperature region when caching turned on. Also, documentation and example scripts have been updated.


Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug in ``xpsi/Signal.py`` when looping over dual temperature components while using caching (D.C., T.S, S.V.). 

* Bug in ``xpsi/Signal.py`` merging the new phase-shift parameter to the parameter subspace (T.S. & D.C.).

* Missing global argument added in ``xpsi/module_generator.py`` (D.C.).

* Documentation and example scripts updated and fixed to work with newest X-PSI versions (S.G.).

* Bug in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/_corner.py`` not showing true values correctly in corner plots for simulated data (T.S. & Y.K.).

[v0.7.9] - 2021-11-26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* New program that automates generation of model modules for common usage
  patterns, in particular the NICER modelling workflow. The program may be
  located at ``xpsi/module_generator.py`` and executed as
  ``python module_generator.py -h`` to see the usage help.


Fixed
^^^^^

* The :class:`~.Background` call method body template and fixed the
  :class:`~.Signal` class to access the correct property of the background
  instance.

* Documentation URLs to reference the organisation repository. (D.H.)


Added
^^^^^

* Functionality to the :class:`~.Data` class method for event handling so that
  it can load events from file when the energy in eV is given.

* Optional maximum energy to use for ray-tracing simulations. Useful if there
  is a background component such as a powerlaw that is jointly modelled with
  higher-energy event data using a subset of instruments.

* A phase-shift parameter for each :class:`~.Signal` instance. If there are
  two or more phase-resolved data-sets, there may be a need to have a phase-
  shifting parameter for each signal. For phase-summed data sets, the phase-
  shift can be arbitrarily fixed. Phase-shifts can be derived from other
  phase-shifts, and one signal's phase-shift can always be fixed as zero and
  thus locked to the phase shifts of the hot regions.

[v0.7.8] - 2021-09-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Correction in the importance sampling function. If the number of MPI
  processes is a factor of the number of samples reweighted, a subset of
  samples, with cardinality equal to the size of the MPU world, was not
  reweighted but is included for renormalisation with the same weight as the
  input weight. E.g., if there is one MPI process, then the last sample is not
  reweighted, so the output weight is equal to the input weight. (S.V.)
* Correction of the image appearing on the :mod:`~.HotRegion` page. (S.V.)
* Minor typos corrected. (T.S. & Y.K.)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Updated the :func:`~.tools.synthesise_exposure` and
  :func:`~.tools.synthesise_given_total_count_number` functions to handle zero
  background and make sure that the input background memory buffer does not get
  modified by the synthesis routines. (T.S. & Y.K.)
* Added a keyword argument to the default background marginalisation function
  to enable passing of a background signal in the form of a channel-phase
  interval buffer. The background should already be averaged over phase
  intervals, having units of counts/s. Useful for phase-dependent backgrounds,
  or a phase-independent background if the channel-by-channel background
  variable prior support is restricted.

Added
^^^^^

* Updates to the project acknowledgements page of the documentation.

[v0.7.7] - 2021-06-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Bugs in mesh cell allocation routine. These bugs occur for some specific
  subset of hot regions with both a superseding member region and a ceding
  member region and both radiate. This bug does not affect any production
  analyses to date, but was encountered by D.C. when preparing a model with
  such a hot region for posterior sampling.
* Importance sampling bug when reweighting the likelihood function.

Added
^^^^^

* Guidelines to the documentation for dependency citation.
* Tips for installing X-PSI on a macOS in the documentation (S.V. & D.C.).
* Some additional lines to install X-PSI on SURFsara's Cartesius (S.V.).
* Instructions to install X-PSI on SURFsara's Lisa (T.S.).

* With thanks to Devarshi Choudhury (D.C.) for noticing and investigating
  potentially buggy mesh construction behaviour that was, indeed, buggy.
* With thanks to Serena Vinciguerra for noticing and investigating
  potentially buggy importance sampling behaviour that was, indeed, buggy.
* With thanks to Serena Vinciguerra (S.V.), D.C., and

[v0.7.6] - 2021-05-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* NB: This patch is unfortunately not backwards compatible. This patch has been
  pushed nevertheless to comply with a NICER collaboration publication which
  uses X-PSI v0.7 with some features from a development version. The analysis is
  open-source, so the development features used have been pushed in this patch.
  The next minor release will officially include these tested features together
  with documentation.

* New skymap plotting functionality and an MPI-capable importance sampling
  method that can handle likelihood function and prior PDF changes. New
  documentation and examples will be made available in the future.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The extension module for default background marginalisation returns a tuple
  with an extra element. This is probably backwards incompatible with custom
  subclasses of the :class:`~.Signal` class.

Added
^^^^^

* Skymap plotting functionality. Examples will be added to the documentation
  in a future patch. The most useful feature is plotting a skymap time-series
  so that the image of the model surface hot regions rotates across and down
  a static figure. This is useful for papers to summarise an animated figure.
  This feature is functional but still being tested and developed.

* An MPI-capable importance sampling method that can handle likelihood function
  and prior PDF changes. This is useful to save computation time. This feature
  is being tested and developed.

Fixed
^^^^^

* A bug in :meth:`~.Likelihood.Likelihood.check` that prevented checking
  the likelihood function for more than one point.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* With thanks to Serena Vinciguerra (S.V.) for testing importance sampling.


[v0.7.5] - 2021-02-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Corner-case stability improvements for default background marginalisation.
* If likelihood function is below :attr:`~.Likelihood.Likelihood.llzero` after
  evaluation, the parameter vector is included in the prior support as
  intended.
* Typo in ``_precision`` function in ``xpsi/PostProcessing/__init__.py``. (S.V.)
* Math typo on the :mod:`~.HotRegion` page. (S.V.)
* Explanatory text in the multiple-imaging tutorial. (T.S.)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* A few image components appearing on the :mod:`~.HotRegion` page. (S.V.)
* Bounds exception now prints the name of the offending parameter in
  :class:`~.Parameter.Parameter`. (S.V.)

Added
^^^^^

* An extension module for calculating hot region local variables from global
  variables for hot region configurations under the umbrella of the PST-U model
  introduced in `Riley et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..21R/abstract>`_.

[v0.7.4] - 2021-01-26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

^^^^^

* Missing packages in ``setup.py`` causing errors when importing xpsi.
* A few typos in the documentation.

* A few images in the documentation.

[v0.7.3] - 2020-11-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Phase-averaging issue that can sometimes occur due to numerical effects when
  comparing two numbers that should be the same but can differ by tiny degrees
  at machine precision level.
* Some documentation typographic errors.


[v0.7.2] - 2020-11-04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Error raised while running ``setup.py`` for linking rayXpanda with
  clang compiler.

[v0.7.1] - 2020-10-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* An ``AttributeError`` raised during runtime linking to the fallback rayXpanda
  implementation.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* With thanks to Devarshi Choudhury for bug testing.


[v0.7.0] - 2020-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* New plotting functionality.
* Should be backwards compatible, but some small internal tweaks or default
  behaviour changes could result in small differences in plots that might not
  even be discernable.

Added
^^^^^

* Option to specify only the number of phases per cycle when calling
  :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image`, instead of having to supply the
  phase set.
* New plot type for animated photon specific intensity skymaps with their
  associated photon specific flux pulse-profiles and the photon specific flux
  spectrum that connects the signals at those energies. See the documentation
  of the :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image` method for options, details,
  and an example.
* Example plots to the :class:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere` documentation.
* New helper methods :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.write_image_data`
  and :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.load_image_data` to write ray map data,
  photon specific intensity image data, and photon specific flux signal data to
  disk, and then read the data back into memory as attributes so that the data
  can be reused to accelerate calls to calculate images and generate static and
  animated plots.
* Option to :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere._plot_sky_maps`,
  ``add_zero_intensity_level``, that applies a colormap such that zero intensity
  corresponds to the lowest colour. In this case a non-radiating part of the
  stellar surface, and the background sky, have well-defined colour. If lowest
  colour in the colormap is instead associated with the lowest finite intensity
  in the skymap panel, then the background sky for instance is assigned the same
  colour so that the least bright part of the image merges with the background
  sky colour. The latter choice resolves the variation in the intensity as a
  function of phase and sky direction better with colour, but the former might
  give more of an indication of the magnitude of the variation in intensity
  as a function of phase and sky direction relative to the background sky.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* A phase set supplied to :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image` can have
  units of cycles, not radians as was previously the requirement, by setting
  the ``phase_in_cycles`` keyword argument to ``True`` if the supplied phase
  array as units of cycles.
* The photon specific flux can be calculated with
  :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image` at far more energies than photon
  specific intensities are cached at, by using the :obj:`cache_energy_indices`
  keyword to supply and array of integers to index the energy array. This
  saves memory and means that imaging with an extension module can be executed
  once to generate both skymaps (which require cached intensities but only
  typically at a few representative energies) and the photon specific flux
  (which does not require cached intensities, but typically is computed for
  a much finer energy array).

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* With thanks to Anna Bilous and Serena Vinciguerra for helpful suggestions
  about the new animated plot type.


[v0.6.3] - 2020-10-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* An ``AttributeError`` raised during runtime linking to the fallback rayXpanda
  implementation.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* With thanks to Devarshi Choudhury for bug testing.


[v0.6.2] - 2020-09-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug in :func:`~.Sample.nested` when initialisation of nested sampler class
  tries to call ``set_default`` dictionary method instead of the correct
  ``setdefault`` method.
* Import errors associated with the :mod:`~.PostProcessing` module.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The :attr:`~.Parameter.Parameter.cached` property of a
  :class:`~.Parameter.Parameter` instance can be set to ``None``.
* The :class:`~.ParameterSubspace.ParameterSubspace` initialiser is decorated
  to avoid verbose output by every MPI process.
* The :class:`~.Prior.Prior` uses the class attribute
  ``__draws_from_support__`` to set the number of Monte Carlo draws from the
  joint prior support to require to set the MultiNest hypervolume expansion
  factor appropriately. The default value is ``5``, which means :math:`10^5`
  draws from the joint prior support.
* Checks if an instance of  ``six.string_types`` in
  :class:`~.PostProcessing._metadata.Metadata`, e.g., to allow unicode strings
  in posterior ID labels.


[v0.6.1] - 2020-09-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug wherein multiple :class:`~.Signal.Signal` instances passed to a
  :class:`~.Likelihood.Likelihood` instance do not have references stored.
* The :mod:`~.tools` synthesis functions adhering to the global phase
  interpolant switch, and updated tutorial accordingly.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The :meth:`~.Data.Data.phase_bin__event_list` constructor signature, so that
  the phase and channel columns can be arbitrary.

Removed
^^^^^^^

* An unused prototype extension module.


[v0.6.0] - 2020-09-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Backwards compatible for most use cases, but possible corner cases.
* Includes a non-critical, but important patch for animating intensity skymaps,
  and updates to the environment file for cloning.
* The new feature is support for higher-order images when invoking an integrator
  that discretises the surface (with a regular mesh). Secondary images can
  be very important, whilst tertiary images less so. Quaternary, quinary, and
  possibly senary images can sometimes be detected and included too, with
  accuracy that decreases with order. Fortunately, the contribution to the
  photon specific flux generally decays rapidly with image order beyond the
  secondary or tertiary images. The computational cost scales almost
  linearly with order *if* an appreciable fraction of every iso-latitudinal ring
  on the surface is multiply-imaged at each order. Note that multiple-imaging
  manifests entirely naturally when an image-plane is discretised in such away
  that the regular mesh resolves the stellar limb sufficiently well, where
  higher-order images get insanely squeezed.

Fixed
^^^^^

* The memory consumption problem of the animator method in
  :class:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere`. Now animation should generally require
  an entirely tracable amount of memory.

Added
^^^^^
.. _rayXpanda: <https://github.com/ThomasEdwardRiley/rayXpanda>

* Multiple-imaging support including an option to specify the maximum image
  order to iterate up to, with automatic truncation when no image at a given
  order is detected. If no limit is specified (the default), then images are
  included as far as they can be detected given the numerical resolution
  settings, which is typically between quaternary and senary images.
* A multiple-imaging tutorial.
* A global switch for changing phase and energy interpolants without
  recompilation of extensions. To change interpolants, you can use top-level
  functions :func:`xpsi.set_phase_interpolant` and
  :func:`xpsi.set_energy_interpolant`. Generally computations are more
  sensitive to the phase interpolants, of which the options from GSL are:
  Steffen spline (pre-v0.6 choice), Akima periodic spline, and cubic periodic
  spline. The default choice is now an Akima periodic spline in an attempt to
  improve interpolation accuracy of the interpolant at function maxima, where
  the accuracy is generally most important in the context of likelihood
  evaluations.  Note that in some corner cases, the signal from a hot region is
  negative in specific flux because there is a correction computed to yield the
  intended signal from :class:`~.Elsewhere.Elsewhere` when it is partially
  masked by hot regions. In this case, when using phase interpolant tools from
  the :mod:`~.tools` and :mod:`~.likelihood` modules it is necessary to use a
  ``allow_negative`` option when calling the tools to specify that a negative
  interpolant is permitted.
* Automatic linking of the package rayXpanda_ for calculation of the inverse of
  the deflection integral, and it's derivative via a high-order symbolic
  expansion, for a subset of primary images. The purpose is to mainly as an
  orthogonal validation of a subset of integrals executed via numerical
  quadrature and inversion via spline interpolation.  The other reason is
  because to support multiple-imaging with the surface-discretisation
  integrators this aforementioned interpolation had to change due to
  non-injectivity of functions when interpolating with respect to the cosine of
  the deflection angle. However, to calculate the convergence derivative
  sufficiently accurately, interpolating with respect to the cosine of the
  deflection seems necessary. Therefore rayXpanda_ can be linked in, if it is
  available, for low deflection angles instead of avoid having to allocate
  additional memory and construct splines specifically for low-deflection
  primary images. Simple testing suggests there are no valuable speed gains,
  however, possibly because the high-order expansion and simultaneous evaluation
  of the polynomial and it's derivate with a nested Horner scheme itself
  requires a substantial number of floating point operations.
* A helper method :meth:`~.ParameterSubspace.ParameterSubspace.merge` that
  merges a set of parameters, or a parameter subspace, or a set of subspaces,
  into a subspace that has already been instantiated.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Updated the Conda ``environment.yml`` file for replication of the development
  environment. The ``basic_environment.yml`` file was also updated in an
  earlier release in an additional necessary package, ``wrapt``.

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``repeat``, ``repeat_delay``, and ``ffmpeg_path`` keyword arguments for
  the animator method in :class:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere`. These were
  ultimately not effective. To repeat the animation intrinsically, set the
  number of ``cycles``, and extrinsically, this can be looped when embedded in
  another environment.


[v0.5.4] - 2020-09-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug due to local variable ``NameError`` when setting instrument channel
  energy edges.
* Bug that prevented a hot region phase parameter from being a fixed or derived
  variable.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* With thanks to Devarshi Choudhury.


[v0.5.3] - 2020-08-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Improvement patches. Deliberately backwards incompatible for safety in
  memory allocation.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Add try-except block to :attr:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.global_to_local_file`
  property so that explicit setting of ``None`` by user is not required if
  file I/O is not needed in the extension module. Actually, ``None`` could
  not be set for the property anyway due to type checking.
* Bug when declaring that sky maps should be animated and memory freed
  beforehand.

Added
^^^^^

* The surface to image-plane ray map is cached in Python process memory so it
  can be efficiently reused for same spacetime configuration and ray map
  resolution settings. Explicit support for writing the ray map to disk and
  loading it is not included, but this should be entirely possible to achieve
  manually. Backwards compatible except for corner cases, such as not using
  keyword arguments when calling :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image`, or if
  resolution settings changed between calls to the imager but a ray map
  otherwise exists in Python process memory and the spacetime configuration has
  not been changed.
* A secret keyword argument to :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image`,
  :obj:`_OVERRIDE_MEM_LIM`, which can be used to change an internal hard limit
  on the intensity cache size. This setting is for safety and designed so that
  higher memory consumption is deliberate or if something goes awry, it is
  deemed the responsibilty of the user to have read method docstring carefully.
  The tutorials will not use this secret keyword, so if the user tries to run
  them and encounters an exception, they will need to investigate the docstring
  and either adapt the resolution to their system or take the responsibility of
  setting the cache size limit for their system to accomodate the resolution
  settings in the tutorial.
* Optional argument to :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image`,
  :obj:`single_precision_intensities`, which flags whether or not to *cache*
  the intensities in single precision do halve intensity cache memory
  requirements. The default is to cache in single precision.
* Verbosity to :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image` because execution
  can take many minutes depending on settings chosen. The verbosity
  can be deactivated via a keyword argument (see the method docstring).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The usage of the :meth:`~.Photosphere.Photosphere.image` argument
  :obj:`cache_intensities`. Instead of simply activating intensity caching
  with boolean, the user must specify a cache size limit that is adhered to.
  If the required cache size given the resolution settings is larger than
  the limit, imaging does not proceed. If the cache size limit is zero or
  equivalent, then imaging safely proceeds without caching the intensities.
* Intensities are by default *cached* in single precision to reduce cache memory
  requirements.


[v0.5.2] - 2020-08-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Python API: small backwards compatible patches to add useful features.
* C API: small backwards incompatible patch to support Python API patch.

Added
^^^^^

* Support for hyperparameters (i.e., parameters of the prior distribution),
  by making :class:`~.Prior.Prior` inherit from
  :class:`~.ParameterSubspace.ParameterSubspace`. Custom hyperparameters can
  then be defined in a subclass initiliser, or otherwise. The hyperparameters
  are merged into the :class:`~.Likelihood.Likelihood` parameter subspace as
  mostly normal parameters (with small caveat in the form of property
  :attr:`~.Parameter.Parameter.is_hyperparameter`) and can have their own
  prior (the hyperprior) implemented in a :class:`~.Prior.Prior` subclass along
  with the other free parameters in the model. A tutorial will be delivered in
  due course. These modifications are backwards compatible.
* Simple support for transforming from global to local variables (for image-
  plane calculations) with the help of a file on disk, whose path can be
  specified dynamically in Python and relayed to the relevant extension where a
  custom model implemention can do I/O with the file. This is useful if one has
  a set of files containing precomputed data, but understandably does not want
  to do filesystem acrobatics or recompile an extension every time the file
  path changes. Setting the file path dynamically in this way is akin to
  changing the value of some discrete variable in the mapping between global
  and local variables. With thanks to Anna Bilous for the suggestion. A tutorial
  will be delivered when possible.
* Added :attr:`~.Instrument.Instrument.channel_edges` property, and updated
  tutorials to reflect this new concrete implementation.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``init_local_variables`` function signature in the header
  ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/local_variables.pxd``, and in the
  corresponding ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/archive/local_variables``
  extensions. You would have to modify a custom extension module manually to
  match the function signature declared in the header.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Removed remnant manual Sphinx method signatures; the decorator now preserves
  the method signature so automated Sphinx doc works on those decorated methods.
* Updated package docstring to reflect name change.
* Uses of ``xpsi.Data.channel_range`` property to adhere to future deprecation.


[v0.5.1] - 2020-08-07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Bug when plotting intensity sky maps because a line was inadvertently
  removed.
* Some mutable defaults in :class:`xpsi.Elsewhere` and :class:`xpsi.Everywhere`.
* Conditional statement in :meth:`xpsi.Photosphere.embed`.

Added
^^^^^

* Capability to add custom parameters when instantiating
  :class:`xpsi.Photosphere`, which is useful for calling image plane extensions
  whilst passing global variables, without having to instantiate
  surface-discretisation classes and without having to handle global variable
  values at compile time or from disk for runtime access.


[v0.5.0] - 2020-08-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* The major change is an update and refactoring of the post-processing module
  to work again with past API changes. (The module was not being kept up to date
  with previous releases listed below because it wasn't to our knowledge
  being used by anyone yet, and thus we focussed on other features.) The module
  has been refactored to be more modular, flexible, and extensible. For
  instance, posterior signal-plot classes can be added by the user and
  complex plotting routines can thus be developed, as demonstrated in the
  concrete classes such as :class:`xpsi.PostProcessing.PulsePlot`. The plot
  classes have been used to reproduce (with improved functionality and
  performance) the relevant signal plots from `Riley et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..21R/abstract>`_, as demonstrated
  in the post-processing tutorial notebook and embedded in the class docstrings
  for reference.
* Development of online documentation pages, including project organisation
  pages and a Code of Conduct (please read), and development of docstrings.
  Note that some snippets of documentation look forward to v1.0 (e.g., release
  of technical notes in the repo itself).

Fixed
^^^^^

* The :class:`xpsi.Data` docstring explanations have been improved for clarity,
  mainly regarding the instrument channel definitions. The explanation is of how
  the information contained in a :class:`xpsi.Data` instance pertains to the
  *loaded* instrument response (sub)matrix.
* The :class:`xpsi.Instrument` docstrings have also been improved for clarity,
  explaining the relationship to :class:`xpsi.Data` in more detail.
* Update extension module for background marginalisation to take distinct phase
  sets associated with hot regions.
* The constructor :meth:`xpsi.Spacetime.fixed_spin` inclination upper bound
  is :math:`\pi/2` radians to eliminate degeneracy due to equatorial-reflection
  symmetry in the default prior on source-receiver geometric configuration.
* Tweak caching (memoization) so that cache and current vectors are equal at
  the end of likelihood evaluation routine.
* Generally clean up naming and docstrings for extension modules. Add return
  types.
* Bug was fixed for transforming posterior sample sets and prior samples when
  parameter orders different in sample files and a prior object due to API
  updates. Whether this solution is to be long-term is to be decided; more
  generally need to figure out how to elegantly handle derived parameters that
  are not needed for likelihood evaluation (those derived parameters are
  instances of :class:`xpsi.Parameter`) but are of interest for post-processing.
* Handle ``param_plot_lims=None`` correctly in
  :class:`xpsi.PostProcessing.CornerPlotter`.
* Checked for unintended mutable defaults package-wide, and fixed as
  appropriate.
* Fix bugs in ``CustomPrior`` class (:ref:`example_script`; these example
  modules were not run at the time of translation between past API versions, so
  only found bugs when making post-processing tutorial for this release).
* The formatting of annotated credible intervals in
  :class:`xpsi.PostProcessing.CornerPlotter` has been improved by inferring the
  largest number of decimal places needed for two non-zero decimal digits, and
  then formatting the median and quantile differences to this shared decimal
  precision above the on-diagonal panels. If the numbers cannot be well-
  represented by this scheme, the user could try a unit transformation.
* Tried to tweak automated margins for intensity sky map multi-panel plots,
  so as not to sometimes partially cut an axis label.
* Bug that prevented animation of sky map frames written to disk because the
  frames were not cached in memory by reimaging.

Added
^^^^^

* The :class:`xpsi.Data` is now concrete in implementation, such that in common
  usage patterns, it does not need to be subclassed.
* A constructor to :class:`xpsi.Data` to load a phase-folded event list and
  phase-bin the events in a subset of selected channels.
* A :meth:`xpsi.Data.channels` property that holds the instrument channels
  to be checked by a :class:`xpsi.Signal` instance against those declared for
  the loaded instrument response (sub)matrix. This property as also required by
  the post-processing module (namely, :class:`xpsi.PostProcessing.ResidualPlot`
  and the other :class:`xpsi._signalplot.SignalPlot` subclasses).
* A :meth:`xpsi.Instrument.channels` property that holds the instrument
  channels to be checked by a :class:`xpsi.Signal` instance against those
  declared for the event data matrix.
* Support for multiple instruments operating on the same incident signal due to
  assumed effective time-invariance of the signal generated during one
  rotational cycle of the surface radiation field.
* Module :mod:`xpsi.surface_radiation_field` to call atmosphere extensions
  directly (without the calls being embedded in integration algorithms), for
  checking implementation of complicated atmospheres such as those requiring
  interpolation with respect to a numerical lookup table.
* Support for the extension module for calculating the local surface radiation
  field variables to read in numerical model data. An example extension module
  designed to execute nearest-neighbour lookup amonst an general unstructured
  array of points of the openness of magnetic field lines has been developed.
* Add simple energy annotation option to photon specific intensity sky-map
  panels.
* State the energy units (keV) that the :class:`xpsi.Instrument` must comply
  with when energy interval bounds are specified.
* State the units of variables such as energy and specific intensity in the
  surface radiation field extension module. These requirements may be found in
  function body comments.
* Explain in :class:`xpsi.PostProcessing.CornerPlotter` docstring the order in
  which posteriors are plotted given the input order.
* Post-processing switches to overwrite transformed-sample files and
  combined-run files on disk.
* Workaround to handle the case where due to API changes, the relationship
  between sample parameter vectors on disk and the parameter vector in the
  current API are related not just by reordering, but transformations. This
  is demonstrated in the post-processing tutorial instead of transforming the
  original sample files on disk in place, the transformed files written to disk
  contain both the transformed vector (same number of elements) to match the
  parameters defined under the current API (the order of the vector can be
  different between the :class:`xpsi.ParameterSubspace` underlying with a
  :class:`xpsi.Likelihood` instance and the files on disk containing the
  transformed samples), and the additional derived parameters.
* Attempt to free up memory when :meth:`xpsi.Photosphere.images` is no longer
  needed, but memory-intensive operations need to be performed.
* Attempt to free memory properly after animating a sky-map phase sequence.

^^^^^^^

* Change (Earth) inclination parameter :math:`i` to :math:`\cos(i)` so that the
  default prior density function is isotropic.
* The object formerly named ``xpsi.Pulse`` has had its name changed to
  :class:`xpsi.Signal`, and across the package, names that were ``pulse`` are
  apart from potential corner cases or documentation instances of the word,
  are now ``signal``, because when support joint likelihood functions over
  multiple instruments, some data sets are phase averaged. Moreover, *signal*
  is arguably clearer in meaning than *pulse*, once it has been established
  that the signals the package focuses on are *pulsed* but depending on
  the instrument, the data we confront the model with has some degree of phase
  (timing) resolution that might be insufficient for phase-resolved
  observations.
* The :class:`xpsi.Data` definition of the ``last`` channel has changed to be
  the index of the last row in the loaded instrument response (sub)matrix,
  instead of being the index of the last row plus one; this means that the
  value exposed via a property is ``last+1``.
* For numerical atmospheres of same number of grid dimensions, improved
  extension ``surface_radiation_field/archive/{hot,elsewhere}/numerical.pyx``
  module to infer grid size for memory allocation and interpolation searches
  (implemented automatic inference of grid size, but hard-coded
  four-dimensional cubic polynomial interpolation persistent). Different
  those atmospheres can be loaded simply via a Python subclass without
  the relevant extension module being recompiled.
* The :class:`xpsi.Photosphere` class sometimes does no surface discretisation,
  so allow no hot regions, elsewhere, or everywhere objects; then image-plane
  discretisation can be accessed without dummy object creation.
* Tweak :class:`xpsi.SpectrumPlot` settings to print a warning statement that
  spectrum plot works best with logarithmic spacing, and the user has to shadow
  class attribute with ``logspace_y=False``.
* Do not print :class:`xpsi.HotRegion` instance parameter properties upon
  creation if fixed at boundary value so that the region is fully described by
  fewer parameters.
* Merged energy integration extension modules into one.
* Made phase shift parameters (strictly) unbounded; remember however that for a
  sensible prior, bound the phase shifts on a unit interval, and thus it is
  required that phase bounds are specified and finite.
* In extensions, modified phase shifting so that a shift permitted by unbounded
  phase parameter does not require many iterations to decrement or increment to
  unit interval (achieved simply with floor operation).

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* The :meth:`xpsi.Data.channel_range` property has been renamed to
  :meth:`xpsi.Data.index_range` so as to avoid confusion between these numbers
  and the true instrument channels. *The old property will be removed for
  release v1.0*.

Removed
^^^^^^^

* The ensemble MCMC sample backend for post-processing because we do not expect
  it to be useful in the immediate future, but requires some non-trivial
  development work to meld properly with the current post-processing module
  which is focussed on nested sampling. This functionality will be reintroduced
  in a future release (refer to :ref:`todo`). The ensemble sampler can still be
  run, however, and the native backend for accessing sample information on disk
  is demonstrated in a tutorial notebook. However, the runs cannot be processed
  for posterior integrals and visualisation using the same tools as available
  for nested sampling runs.

[v0.4.1] - 2020-06-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Function signatures to match header declarations in atmosphere extensions:
  ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/archive/elsewhere/numerical.pyx`` to match
  ``xpsi/surface_radiation_field/elsewhere_radiation_field.pxd``.
  With thanks to Sebastien Guillot.


[v0.4.0] - 2020-02-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Mainly new features.
* Backwards compatible (apart from possible corner cases).

Fixed
^^^^^

* Removed a spurious geometric factor in the integrator that discretises the
  surface with a static mesh. This integrator was called by the ``Elsewhere``
  class. The error when this factor is included is O(1%) at 600 Hz for soft
  emission from the entire stellar disk, and then scales with spin and energy
  beyond this. To reproduce the bug, find the commented out ``/ superlum`` in
  file ``xpsi/cellmesh/integrator_for_time_invariance.pyx`` (line 251) and
  uncomment it. Then reinstall the package. When this factor is included, the
  mesh itself is moving in the context of the images subtended by its
  constituent elements on our sky. We want the mesh to be static so that this
  integrator can be used for faster calculation of time-invariant signals.
* Bug in which the prior density factor is incorporated twice if a ``Likelihood``
  instance held a reference to a ``Prior`` object and these are merged into
  a ``Posterior`` object which is fed to the ensemble sampler. If the prior
  density was *flat*, this bug will have had no effect on posterior
  distributions.

Added
^^^^^

* New features are the simulation of signals from more general surface
  radiation fields that globally span the stellar surface. This can be
  done with several types of integrator.
* The new image-plane discretisation integrator supports imaging of a star,
  and Python functionality has been added to automate plotting and animation
  of intensity sky maps.
* A new tutorial to the documentation to demonstrate these new features and
  an internal cross-check of distinct integration algorithms.
* A visual introduction to the documentation pages with some animated sky maps.


[v0.3.6] - 2020-01-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Some code snippets in documentation examples of prior implementation
  with the latest API minor version (v0.3).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Modify the ``HotRegions`` class to function with two *or more* hot region
  objects.


[v0.3.5] - 2020-01-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Docstring edits and backwards compatible changes to several class
  initialisation arguments.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Based mostly on discussion with and feedback from Devarshi Choudhury.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Some docs formatting problems.
* Some corrections to example scripts/modules updated in v0.3.4 to use
  current API.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The photospheric mode frequency parameter is not converted to an angular
  frequency until it is used, so the cached value matches the docstring
  description.

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``is_secondary`` argument of the ``HotRegion`` class. Use ``is_antiphased`` instead
  to ensure future compatibility.
* The ``store`` argument of the ``Pulse`` class. Use ``cache`` instead to ensure future
  compatibility.


[v0.3.4] - 2020-01-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* A few patches including backwards compatible improvements.
* Various docstring/comment/doc edits.
* Update docs example model to use v0.3.4 API.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Ensure consistency between input parameter ``bounds`` and ``values`` by
  always requiring dictionaries. Fix applies to ``Elsewhere`` and
  ``Photosphere``. Courtesy Sebastien Guillot.
* Gravitational mass doc typo fix.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Add input argument checks to ``Likelihood.check`` method.
* Add default ``hypercube=None`` to ``Prior.inverse_sample_and_transform``
  method.
* If derived parameters found in subspace, assume an update is needed because
  cache mechanism not in place. (WIP.)


[v0.3.3] - 2020-01-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* At several places in the ``Likelihood`` class, calls were place to ``self``,
  forgetting that ``Likelihood`` overwrites ``ParameterSubspace.__call__``.
  Now calls are ``super(Likelihood, self).__call__()`` to obtain the current
  parameter vector.

[v0.3.2] - 2020-01-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Bug fixes. Backwards compatible.
* When initializing the ensemble-MCMC chains using an nd-ball, the inclusion
  in the prior support was checked by passing a vector to ``Prior.__call__`` but
  that code assumed that the parameter vector had already been assigned and
  can be accessed through the ``ParameterSubspace``. As a result either an
  exception would be thrown (if parameter objects have no value set) or the
  support condition would be evaluated for some preset vector that does not
  change has we iterate through chains.
* The ``Likelihood.check`` method now has a fallback implementation given that
  the NumPy ``allclose`` function in v1.17 does not support Python 2.7.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Based on testing by Sebastien Guillot.

Fixed
^^^^^

* The ``EnsembleSampler`` so that it does not rely on the ``CustomPrior.__call__``
  implementation to handle a vector argument. Chains should now be in
  prior support from the start and never leave.
* The ``Likelihood.check`` method so that a call to a ``Likelihood`` instance
  updates the parameters with a vector if the physical points are passed
  for value checking.
* The ``Likelihood.check`` method error error handling and if/else branching
  has been fixed.
* Some typographic errors in docs.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The way ``EnsembleSampler`` accesses the prior object.


[v0.3.1] - 2019-12-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Some docstring and Sphinx-related formatting.


[v0.3.0] - 2019-12-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary
^^^^^^^

* Not backwards compatible.
* The main feature is a more sophisticated backend for handling parameters,
  parameter subspaces, and the object hierarchy that forms the modelling
  language. Notably, the parameter objects can be accessed everywhere more
  readily, with dictionary-like functionality that alleviates the problem
  of remembering the imposed order of parameters in a vector. Resultantly,
  there is much more freedom when a user constructs a model and interfaces
  it with sampling software.
* Model parameters can either be *free*, *fixed/frozen* at some scalar value,
  or *derived* deterministically from other model parameters.
* The docs and tutorials have also been updated to reflect these developments.

Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Feedback and ideas for the above development were discussed at an X-PSI
  workshop in Amsterdam, November 25-29 2019:
  Sebastien Guillot, Emma van der Wateren, Devarshi Choudhury, Pushpita Das,
  Anna Bilous, and Anna Watts.

Added
^^^^^

* A new class ``xpsi.Parameter`` of which every model parameter is an instance.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``xpsi.ParameterSubspace`` class, which has far more sophisticated behaviours
  as a parameter container. The class, upon initialisation with arguments,
  also merges parameters and subspaces into a higher-dimensional (sub)space.
  Most other classes in the modelling language *inherit* from the
  ``xpsi.ParameterSubspace`` class.
* The ``xpsi.TwoHotRegions`` class is now dedicated to representing antipodally
  reflection-symmetric configurations only to simplify the choice of which
  class to use between ``xpsi.HotRegions`` and ``xpsi.TwoHotRegions``. However,
  antipodally reflection-symmetric models can also be constructed using
  just ``xpsi.HotRegions`` because of the new *derived* parameter support. The
  may be a minor speed difference: ``xpsi.TwoHotRegions``
  should be very slightly faster, but it might be imperceptible. Future
  warning: in the future ``xpsi.TwoHotRegions`` might removed altogther for
  simplication.
* The ``xpsi.Photosphere`` class can be instantiated to encapsulate only a
  reference to an ``xpsi.Elsewhere`` instance, and no ``xpsi.HotRegion`` instances.
  An ``xpsi.Elsewhere`` instance can by definition only generate a
  phase-invariant signal. However, further development is needed to handle
  this phase-invariant signal efficiently for likelihood functionality,
  given that operations with respect to phase are not required. Instead
  likelihood functions would be defined only with respect to energy.

Removed
^^^^^^^

* The ``xpsi.ParameterSpace`` module. The global model parameter space is also
  simply an intance of the ``xpsi.ParameterSubspace`` class.
