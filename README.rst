X-PSI
=====

**An open-source package for neutron star**
**\ X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference.**

|Build Status Main| |Docs| |GitHub Release|

X-PSI is designed to simulate rotationally-modified (pulsed) surface 
X-ray emission from neutron stars, taking into account relativistic 
effects on the emitted radiation. This can then be used to perform 
Bayesian statistical inference on real or simulated astronomical data 
sets. Model parameters of interest may include neutron star mass and 
radius (useful to constrain the properties of ultradense nuclear matter) 
or the system geometry and properties of the hot emitting surface-regions. 
To achieve this, X-PSI couples code for likelihood functionality (simulation) 
with existing open-source software for posterior sampling (inference).

It provides the following functionality:

* Simulation of time- and energy resolved X-ray emission (pulse profiles) from the surfaces of neutron stars.
* The facility to implement multiple models for surface patterns, atmospheres, and different instruments.
* Coupling of pulse simulation functionality to statistical sampling software to infer spacetime and geometric parameters from pulse profile data.
* An extensive suite of post-processing software to visualize posteriors and measures of model quality.



For more details on current and planned capabilities, check out the 
`XPSI documentation <https://xpsi-group.github.io/xpsi/index.html>`_.

Installation and Testing
------------------------

X-PSI has a complex set of dependencies, and is therefore currently best 
installed from source. The documentation provides
`step-by-step installation instructions <https://xpsi-group.github.io/xpsi/install.html>`_
for Linux and for limited MacOS systems.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for XPSI, including a wide range of tutorials and scripts for 
running XPSI on HPC systems, can be found at `https://xpsi-group.github.io/xpsi/ <https://xpsi-group.github.io/xpsi/>`_.
