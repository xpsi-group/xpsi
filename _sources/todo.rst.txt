Future
------

If there is a feature you would like to see that is not currently
implemented in the package please let us know!

We are currently working on the following upgrades:

* Making X-PSI faster in various ways: machine learning techniques, GPUs, efficiency improvements to individual elements of the process such as the ray-tracing, background marginalization, data binning, atmospheric interpolation.
* Improving options for energy binning, tailored to specific instrument parameters. 
* Having the option of specifying EOS model-informed mass-radius priors.
* Testing the robustness of universal relations used in the code.
* Improving plotting and graphics routines to visualize results.
* Defining and implementing code standards
