    "In this tutorial we will set up an accretion disk, which is a radiation source separate from the star, and add its contribution to the signal. The accretion disk we will use here (Mitsuda et al. 1984, Makishima et al. 1986) is a superposition of multicolor blackbody rings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We follow here the description given in Makishima et al. 1986. The disk is parametrized by an inner cut-off radius, $R_\\rm{in}$, a temperature at this radius, $T_\\rm{in}$, and an outer radius, $R_\\rm{out}$. The outer rings typically contribute much less to the overal spectrum than inner rings due to being colder, so the exact value of $R_\\rm{out}$ is much less consequential than $R_\\rm{in}$. For each ring, the temperature at some radius $T(r)$ is determined by the energy release associated with accretion towards a central object of mass $M_*$. It is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(r) = \\left(\\frac{3 G \\dot{M} M_x}{8 \\pi \\sigma r^3}\\right)^{1/4}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The specific luminosity (energy/time/energy) from both sides of one ring between $r-dr$ and $r$ is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_\\rm{ring}(E) = 8 \\pi r B(E,T) dr \\int d\\Omega = 8 \\pi^2 B(E,T) r dr = 4\\pi\\sigma T^4 r dr.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "we obtained a factor of $\\pi$ from the integral over the solid angle. One factor of 2 is associated with the two sides of the disk and another factor of 2 appears since we define the $B(E, T)$, which is the blackbody spectral radiance, as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$B(E,T) = \\frac{E^3}{c^2h^2}\\left[\\exp{\\left(\\frac{E}{k_\\rm{B}T}\\right)-1}\\right]^{-1}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is missing the factor of 2 you typically see in contemporary literature. The specific flux of the disk $f_\\rm{disk}(E)$ (energy/time/length$^2$/energy) is the integral of the contribution of each ring from $R_\\rm{in}$ to $R_\\rm{out}$. But, this can be conveniently expressed as an integral over $dT$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_\\rm{disk}(E) = \\frac{2 \\pi \\cos{i}}{D^2}\\int_{R_\\rm{in}}^{R_\\rm{out}} r B(E,T(r)) dr = \\frac{8\\pi R_\\rm{in}^2 \\cos{i}}{3 D^2 T_\\rm{in}}\\int_{T_\\rm{out}}^{T_\\rm{in}}\\Big(\\frac{T}{T_\\rm{in}}\\Big)^{-11/3}B(E,T) dT.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we applied $F = L/(4\\pi D^2)$ to get the flux at distance $D$ and we introduced $\\cos{i}$ to scale the flux to account for the viewing angle. Finally, to obtain the bolometric flux (energy/length^2/time) of the disk one needs to integrate over energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_\\rm{disk} = \\int f_\\rm{disk} dE.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the photon flux for the disk instead of energy flux, one can repeat this process but with $b(E,T)$ instead of $B(E,T)$, which is the blackbody spectral radiance per photon energy: $b(E, T) = B(E,T)/E$. "
