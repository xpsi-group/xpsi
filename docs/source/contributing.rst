Contributing
------------

We outline below the workflow we use for developing X-PSI.

Contact
~~~~~~~

You can interact with the X-PSI :ref:`team` in the public domain on GitHub.
We may also be contacted privately at *xpsi-team[at]googlegroups.com*.
Private development between releases is performed in a private repository on
BitBucket. We communicate internally in our Slack workspace, in a mixture of
private and open channels.

To contribute to this project you can do so whilst being recognised as either
a community member or a team member. If you contribute to feature development
publicly on GitHub, you may well be invited to be recognised as a team member in
the :ref:`acknowledgements`, and to join the mailing group and our Slack
workspace.

Community members can request to join our Slack workspace without being
recognised as a team member (or developing features). Community members who
are experienced users and are willing to donate some of their time to assisting
other X-PSI users (the potential benefits of engaging in such interaction are
perhaps self-explanatory) may also request to join the X-PSI team without
developing features.

Past developers are recognised as team members unless they no longer wish to be.
Aside from acknowledging your contribution, this is useful for feature
maintenance and as a contact point for questions, if permission is granted.
Past team members will be acknowledged as such.

If you are a grant-holder and wish to base a major research project on the
development and/or application of X-PSI, we invite you to discuss you (and your
group where applicable) joining the X-PSI team in order to collaborate. If you
find this idea interesting then please contact Anna L. Watts (contact details
are on the :ref:`acknowledgements` page). You are entirely free to develop
X-PSI only in the public domain on GitHub, of course, but we can likely better
organise and execute this work by using a mixture of private and public
platforms. If you are applying X-PSI in research as an end-user, a private
plaform for communication is probably desirable, and we invite you to request
access to our Slack workspace.


.. _workflow:

Git workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

X-PSI is an open-source project and we aspire that all X-PSI versions required
for reproducibility of publications have release tags on GitHub.

End-users and community contributors can interact with the project freely on
GitHub. If you wish to contribute code, either in the form of a patch, a tweak,
or a feature, but you are uncertain about the workflow, we now provide an
advisory workflow.

* Clone the ``xpsi`` repository to your local computer:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/xpsi-group/xpsi.git <path/to/xpsi>

* You will be on the ``master`` branch by default; this branch by default tracks
  the official (or central) ``origin/master`` branch. Moreover, ``master``
  is merely to act as an image of ``origin/master``, meaning that official
  upstream commits can always be applied to ``master`` via a fast-foward merge.

* Checkout a local branch for your work, which we'll assume is some patch, but
  could be a feature or otherwise:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b patch/fix_something

* Commit your work to ``patch/fix_something``:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -m 'patch something'

* Check to see if any there are any new upstream commits, which would mean
  that ``patch/fix_something`` and ``origin/master`` have diverged:

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch origin master:master

* If the branches have diverged, you can either rebase ``patch/fix_something``
  on ``master`` or merge ``master`` into ``patch/fix_something``, in either
  case resolving any conflicts:

.. code-block:: bash

    git rebase master <or> git merge master

* Note that if you have already pushed ``patch/fix_something`` to a remote
  repository you own (such as a fork of ``xpsi``; see below), and especially
  if this is accessible by others (e.g., via  submitted pull request), you
  should only consider merging ``master`` into ``patch/fix_something`` in
  order to preserve the branch history.

* After integrating upstream changes, you might decide to continue working
  on your branch. Alternatively, you could work on another branch for a
  different patch or feature. In either case you should repeat the process
  of integrating upstream changes as appropriate, and as a requirement if
  preparing for a pull request (although there could be exceptional corner
  cases wherein an X-PSI team member assists with this merging process).

* Once you are ready to contribute your work to the ``xpsi`` repository,
  generally meaning that you have integrated any upsteam changes from ``xpsi``,
  you need a fork of the ``xpsi`` repository on the same hosting platform
  (GitHub). You can create a fork using the GitHub GUI.

* With the address of your ``fork`` you can add it as a remote to your local
  repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add fork https://github.com/<username>/xpsi.git

* Now push ``patch/fix_something`` to ``fork``, creating a remote branch
  ``fork/patch/fix_something`` that ``patch/fix_something`` tracks:

.. code-block:: bash

    git push -u fork

* Now you can submit a pull request, using the GitHub GUI, from
  ``fork/patch/fix_something`` to ``xpsi/master``. Please reference any open
  issues that are to be closed or are relevant to the proposed changes.

* You can update the pull-request topic branch by pushing additional commits
  from ``patch/fix_something`` to ``fork/patch/fix_something``, which will
  update the pull request automatically:

.. code-block:: bash

    git push

* The pull request will then be reviewed and discussed. The proposed changes
  will either be  merged or a merge will be pending because we request
  additional commits on the pull-request topic branch. Your pull request may be
  declined in some instances because the work reproduces development work that
  has already been performed but not published; your pull request may also be
  ultimately declined if it contains changes or implementations that we do not
  support or cannot maintain, and which cannot for some reason be separated
  from changes we do support and could maintain. Your intellectual contribution
  to the project will be gratefully acknowledged in the :ref:`acknowledgements`
  and/or in the project :ref:`history` if this interaction leads to some form
  of merged development/implementation by another community member, even if your
  pull request is ultimately declined.

* If you co-authored a pull request with one or more collaborators, you can
  acknowledge them using the GitHub pull-request GUI as you would for a single
  commit. When a pull request is accepted, it is typically going to be via a
  merge-squash unless the history is clean or work will continue to be
  commited on the topic branch after the merge (where applicable). In this
  case it is the responsiblity of the X-PSI team member executing the merge
  to replicate the list of co-authors from the original pull request in the
  squash message.

* When a pull request is merged, conflicts will either need to be resolved
  locally by you as suggested above, ending in a pull request update, or by an
  X-PSI team member locally and then merged with or without a pull request.

* If you are ready to start development on a distinct patch or feature that is
  not conditional on your open pull requests being merged, then you can apply
  the workflow above by branching (again) off of an up-to-date ``master``.
  If your work *is* conditional on your open pull requests, you are free to
  continue your development by commiting to the relevant topic branch (or
  according to some other branching scheme). However, there is a risk that more
  work will be needed if the open pull request is not merged into the central
  repository; or if only a subset of proposed changes are merged; or conflict
  resolution does not favour all of the changes you proposed. Of course, such
  work may nevertheless remain useful in your own applications even if it is
  never all merged into the central repository. If the pull request is merged
  after your continuation, and the plan is submit a future pull request, you
  will have to merge in the ``xpsi/master`` branch before opening another
  pull request so that the merge conflicts that were already resolved are not
  raised again.

* The above workflow also applies to remote branches other than ``master`` that
  might exist in the ``xpsi`` repository that you wish to contribute to, but
  this should be a less common pattern.

If you want to contribute a feature, you are welcome to communicate with us
either on GitHub via issues and pull-requests, or on a private platform
(see below).


BitBucket repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most feature development by the X-PSI team is conducted on private platforms
including a private development repository .

The X-PSI team works with respect to a private centralised repository
``xpsi_dev`` and pushes releases to a public GitHub repository. These very
online documentation pages are only built and pushed to GitHub to be hosted,
usually by a designated X-PSI team member responsible for this process.
Commits directly on GitHub via pull requests (e.g., patches) are fetched and
merged with the on-going development work.

Otherwise, the workflow with respect to the BitBucket repository is very similar
to the GitHub workflow. Development work is commited to branches which
are then merged into the ``xpsi_dev/dev`` branch directly (for those with
write permissions) or by pull request. In this context ``xpsi_dev/dev`` takes
the role of the ``xpsi/master`` branch on GitHub described above.

When the ``xpsi_dev`` branch is considered feature-complete for a release, it
will be merged into ``xpsi_dev/master`` directly, or via a release branch.
Then, ``xpsi_dev/master`` will be published to ``xpsi/master`` via a fast-foward
merge. Alternatively, a local merge of ``xpsi/master`` and
``xpsi_dev/master`` might be needed, which is subsequently pushed to both
``xpsi`` and ``xpsi_dev``. The definitive release commit will be tagged and the
tags pushed to both repositories.

X-PSI community members with access to ``xpsi_dev``, be it either with write
or read permissions (to some subset of branches), will add ``xpsi_dev`` as a
remote to their local repository. Checking one's remotes should yield output
such as:

.. code-block:: bash

    (xpsi) [15:24:19][xpsi]$ git remote -v
    DEV     https://ThomasEdwardRiley@bitbucket.org/ThomasEdwardRiley/xpsi_dev.git (fetch)
    DEV     https://ThomasEdwardRiley@bitbucket.org/ThomasEdwardRiley/xpsi_dev.git (push)
    origin  https://github.com/xpsi-group/xpsi.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/xpsi-group/xpsi.git (push)

If you have forked repositories (your own forks or those of other community
members for collaborative purposes) these would also be remotes of the local
repository and would be listed here. A local ``master`` branch would track
either ``xpsi_dev/master`` or ``xpsi/master``. A local ``dev`` branch would
track ``xpsi_dev/dev``. All other branches checked out from some upstream
source, be it an ``xpsi_dev`` or ``xpsi`` branch, or a branch from another
community member's fork, will track those remote branches. Branches that you
create and commit to locally will be pushed usually to your own fork for a pull
request, unless you have write permissions to push directly to another
repository.

A useful online description of a model on which this development structure is
based is `available <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.
