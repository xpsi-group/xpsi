Literature
~~~~~~~~~~

This project is built upon the work of many researchers in many fields. For
citations to (astro)physics and (astro)statistics literature, please see the
technical documents pointed to in the :ref:`citation` section. Moreover, we
point to the bibliograpy of `Riley et al. 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887L..21R/abstract>`_ as the first published application of
the X-PSI package, and to the `ApJL Focus Issue <https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_NICER_Constraints_on_the_Dense_Matter_Equation_of_State>`_
of which this article is a member. For other scientific papers that have used
