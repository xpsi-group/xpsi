Applications
------------

X-PSI was applied in the following contexts. These may be useful for rough
performance benchmarking and planning of resource consumption.

If you used X-PSI for a project and have time to summarise it here, please
contact the X-PSI team and/or submit pull-request on GitHub.

**Resource consumption**

The calculations reported were performed on the Dutch national supercomputer
Cartesius, mostly on the *Broadwell* nodes (i.e., using CPUs only, usually
*Broadwell* architecture).
A number of models were applied, with increasing complexity.
Typically, ~1000+ cores were used for posterior sampling, when the
parallelisation is weighted by time consumed.
In total, the sampling problems in R19 required ~450,000 core hours.

**Likelihood function settings**

On compute nodes, the likelihood function evaluation times ranged from ~1 to
~3 seconds (single-threaded), depending on the model and point in parameter
space.\ [#]_ The parallelisation was purely via MPI, with all but one process
receiving likelihood function evaluation requests.

*Resolution settings*

+ number of surface cells/elements per hot (closed) region:\ [#]_ 24x24
+ number of phases (linearly spaced): 100
+ number of energies (logarithmically spaced): 175
+ number of rays (per parallel; linear in cosine of ray angle alpha):\ [#]_ 200

*Interpolation settings*

+ Steffen splines (GSL) were used everywhere apart from for the atmosphere
+ for the atmosphere cubic polynomial interpolants were used in four dimensions


**Compilation**

Intel compiler collection,\ [#]_ with the CORE-AVX2 instruction set, for X-PSI
and dependencies (apart from :mod:`numpy`, which was centrally installed).

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Variation between models on the same processor results from a
       combination of model complexity and resolution settings. Variation
       as a function of parameters also occurs due to issues like mesh
       construction on the surface subject to the resolution settings.

.. [#] This is the approximate number of cells that have centres lying
       within a hot region. For models where a hot region has two temperature
       components these cells are split between the subregions according to
       area only such that the surface density of cells is commensurate---at
       least for subregions that are commensurate in shape. The *fast*
       precomputation mode was deactivated but if it were activated the
       distribution of cells would further be weighted by the approximate
       total number of counts generated by each subregion.

.. [#] The rays were integrated for each likelihood function call instead of
       loading lookup tables from disk, or using an analytic treatment such as
       a high-order expansion (see, e.g.,
       `rayXpanda <https://github.com/ThomasEdwardRiley/rayXpanda>`_).
       Only primary images were included.

.. [#] On Cartesius (and Lisa), one can simply execute
       ``module load intel/2017b`` to access these compilers from the toolchain.
